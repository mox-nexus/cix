# craft-explanations

Explanation craft through simultaneous encoding. Part of the [cix](../../) marketplace.

## What This Plugin Does

Helps Claude write explanations that carry all three doors simultaneously — principle, concretions, and ground — so the receiver pulls what they need rather than being forced through a prescribed sequence.

## The Three Doors

| Door | Explanation | Engineering | Philosophy |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **1** | Principle | Abstraction | Universal |
| **2** | Concretions | Planning | Constituency |
| **3** | Ground | Execution | Self |

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **craft-explanations** | Three Doors encoding, modal lock diagnosis, explanation routing |
| **weaving** | Re-weave modal-locked content across all three doors |
| **visual-communication** | Diagram type selection (Mermaid, D2, C4), visual explanation design |
| **information-architecture** | Collection-level structure, single source of truth, layer model |

## Agents

| Agent | Entry Door | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **feynman** | Door 3 (Ground · Execution · Self) | Docs, tutorials, teaching |
| **sagan** | Door 1 (Principle · Abstraction · Universal) | Vision docs, concept overviews |
| **tufte** | Door 2 (Concretions · Planning · Constituency) | Diagram decisions, data explanation |
| **socrates** | Forces traversal across all doors | Reviewing explanations, deepening understanding |

## Design Philosophy

See `docs/explanation/methodology.md` for the full rationale. Key points:

- **Three Doors** — principle, concretions, and ground as simultaneous dimensions, not sequential layers
- **Directional modal lock** — shifts go through the next door (1→2→3), not a skip
- **Wider, not louder** — encode all three doors so signal survives lossy compression
- **Dimensional shift** — the most powerful moments happen when understanding crosses doors
- **Constituency is the bridge** — you can't reach Self without passing through Constituency
