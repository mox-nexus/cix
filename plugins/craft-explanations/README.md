# craft-explanations

Write explanations that land with different audiences simultaneously. Uses the Three Doors framework — principle, concretions, and ground — so the receiver pulls what they need instead of being forced through a prescribed sequence.

## When to Use

- Writing docs that need to teach multiple audiences
- Explanations that only resonate with one type of reader
- Diagrams that feel incomplete or confusing
- Content that's too abstract or too concrete
- Restructuring documentation collections

## The Three Doors

| Door | What It Carries | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **1 — Principle** | Abstraction, universal truth | "Why does this matter?" |
| **2 — Concretions** | Planning, constituency | "Who is this for and how?" |
| **3 — Ground** | Execution, self | "Show me, let me do it" |

Good explanations encode all three. Most get stuck in one door (modal lock).
