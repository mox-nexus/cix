# arch-guild

13 agents, orthogonal perspectives, structured architectural deliberation.

**Skills**: architecture, design, operations, scaffold
**Agents**: K, Karman, Burner, Lamport, Erlang, Vector, Ace, Ixian, Dijkstra, Knuth, Lotfi, Taleb, Chesterton

Each agent has one domain and an orthogonality lock — they cannot discuss anything outside it. This forces genuine perspective diversity instead of 14 variations of the same opinion.

## Quick start

```
"Review this architecture"           → Guild deliberation
"Is this ready for production?"      → Operations lenses (Taleb/Erlang/Vector)
"Scaffold a hex service"             → Workflow-driven project scaffolding
"Should I use Redis or HashMap?"     → Focus mode on relevant agents
```
