# arch-guild

13 orthogonal agents for structured architectural deliberation. Each agent has one domain and an orthogonality lock — they provide genuine perspective diversity, not 13 variations of the same opinion.

## When to Use

- Reviewing architecture or system design
- Evaluating production readiness
- Checking boundaries, coupling, consistency
- Scaffolding new services
- Resolving design disagreements with structured analysis

## Quick Start

```
"Review this architecture"           → Full guild deliberation
"Is this ready for production?"      → Operations lenses (Taleb/Erlang/Vector)
"Scaffold a hex service"             → Workflow-driven project scaffolding
"Should I use Redis or HashMap?"     → Focused agents (Lamport/Knuth)
"Check this for security issues"     → Vector threat analysis
```

## Skills

| Skill | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| `architecture` | System design, boundaries, async patterns, hexagonal |
| `design` | API contracts, naming, abstractions, DX |
| `operations` | Production readiness, resilience, chaos scenarios |
| `scaffold` | Bootstrapping new projects with architectural patterns |

## Agents

| Agent | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| **K** | Strategic forces, constraints, optionality |
| **Burner** | Boundaries, coupling, dependency direction |
| **Vector** | Attack surface, security, threat modeling |
| **Lamport** | Distributed consistency, ordering, partitions |
| **Dijkstra** | Formal correctness, state machines, invariants |
| **Knuth** | Algorithmic complexity, scaling, performance |
| **Erlang** | Flow dynamics, backpressure, capacity |
| **Taleb** | Failure modes, resilience, antifragility |
| **Lotfi** | Trade-off scoring, fuzzy evaluation |
| **Ace** | Developer experience, cognitive load |
| **Ixian** | Validation criteria, experiment design |
| **Karman** | Domain modeling, naming, semantic truth |
| **Chesterton** | Historical context, why things exist |
