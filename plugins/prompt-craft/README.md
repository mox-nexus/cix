# prompt-craft

Prompt engineering grounded in research. Different model architectures need different techniques.

## Skills

| Skill | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| `deep-reasoning` | Prompting o1, o3, Gemini Deep Think |
| `deep-research` | AI-assisted research with citation accuracy |
| `synthesize-papers` | Multi-paper analysis and literature review |
| `assimilate-writing` | Replicating writing style from examples |

## Philosophy

- **Evidence over intuition** — techniques backed by research
- **Architecture-aware** — what works for Claude ≠ what works for o1
- **Composable** — each skill is orthogonal
