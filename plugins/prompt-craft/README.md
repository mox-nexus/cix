# prompt-craft

Prompt engineering grounded in research. Different model architectures need different techniques.

## Skills

| Skill | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| `deep-reasoning` | Prompting o1, o3, Gemini Deep Think |
| `deep-research` | AI-assisted research with citation accuracy |
| `synthesize-papers` | Multi-paper analysis and literature review |

## Philosophy

- **Evidence over intuition** — techniques backed by research
- **Architecture-aware** — what works for Claude ≠ what works for o1
- **Composable** — each skill is orthogonal

## Sources

Research from 2024-2026 including:
- Many-Shot ICL (ACL/NeurIPS 2024)
- Chain-of-Verification (Meta Research)
- Deep reasoning model techniques (o1, o3, Gemini Deep Think)
