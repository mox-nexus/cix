## Research Foundations

### Transparency and Control

**Blaurock et al. (2024). "AI-Based Service Experience: A Meta-Analysis of 106 Studies." Journal of Service Research.**

- Transparency: β = 0.415 (significant positive effect)
- Process Control: β = 0.507 (strongest predictor)
- Engagement features: b = -0.555 (negative for frequent users)

### Cognitive Effects

**Lee H.P. et al. (2025). "The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking." CHI 2025.**
- AI confidence negatively correlates with critical thinking (β = -0.69)

**Gerlich (2025). "AI Use and Critical Thinking." Societies.**
- Strong negative correlation (r = -0.75)

**Kosmyna et al. (2025). "Your Brain on ChatGPT: Cognitive Debt." MIT Media Lab.**
- 83% of AI users couldn't recall content from AI-assisted work

### Skill Degradation

**Budzyń et al. (2025). "AI-Assisted Colonoscopy." The Lancet.**
- 20% skill decline after 3 months of AI assistance removal

**Fernandes et al. (2025). "LSAT Performance with AI." CHI 2025.**
- Performance gain d = 1.23 with AI, capability not retained

### Learning Orientation

**ACU (2025). "Mastery vs Performance Orientation." Australian Catholic University.**
- Mastery → Critical thinking: OR = 35.7
- Performance → Critical thinking: Z = -6.295 (negative)

### Code Security

**Tihanyi et al. (2024). "AI Code Vulnerabilities." Empirical Software Engineering.**
- 62% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities

**Fu et al. (2024). "Python CWE Weaknesses." ACM TOSEM.**
- 29.5% of AI Python code has CWE weaknesses

**Perry et al. (2025). "7,703 AI-Generated Files."**
- Security degrades 3x through iteration

### Verification

**Dhuliawala et al. (2024). "Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination." ACL 2024.**
- CoVE achieves 50-70% hallucination reduction

## Statistical Glossary

| Statistic | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **d** (Cohen's d) | Effect size (0.2 small, 0.5 medium, 0.8 large) |
| **β** (beta) | Regression coefficient (strength/direction) |
| **r** (correlation) | Linear relationship (0.3 moderate, 0.5 strong) |
| **OR** (odds ratio) | Likelihood ratio (OR=35.7 = 35.7x more likely) |

## Caveats

- Most studies are not software-developer specific
- Longitudinal AI-coding studies don't yet exist
- Effect sizes transfer imperfectly across domains
- Research provides direction, not precision
