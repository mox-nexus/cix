# Why It Matters

The junior developer who starts using AI in 2025 will be a senior engineer by 2030. What they internalise now is what they will teach.

## The Person This Is About

Picture someone six months into their first engineering job. They're competent, fast-learning, working in a codebase they don't fully understand yet. They reach for AI on almost every problem — not because they're lazy, but because it works. The code ships. Their manager is happy. They get faster at reading AI output, at knowing which suggestions to accept, at wiring together solutions they didn't generate.

In five years, they run a team. They interview candidates. They define how code review works, what "good enough" means, whether PRs get sent back for explanation or just merged. They set the defaults for the next ten people who join.

This is why it matters. Not because one person's habits are catastrophic, but because the patterns established early propagate outward. Dependency compounds across careers. It scales across teams.

## Compounding Works Both Ways

The compounding mechanism cuts in two directions, and both are measurable.

On the negative side: Zhou et al. studied what happened when creative workers who had used AI extensively returned to unaided work. Creativity dropped — expected. What wasn't expected was that the deficit persisted and kept widening. Not a temporary adjustment while the brain recalibrated. A trajectory that continued downward. The researchers named it the "creative scar." Each cycle of offloading made independent work harder, which made offloading more appealing, which deepened the next scar.

On the positive side: Shen & Tamkin studied 52 engineers learning a new Python library with AI access. Mastery scores ranged from 24% to 86% — from the same tool, in the same timeframe, with only four extra minutes separating the highest performers from the lowest. The difference was pattern. Engineers who generated code with AI and then asked follow-up questions to understand it scored 86% mastery. Engineers who accepted AI output and moved on scored 39%. Every comprehension cycle made the next question sharper. Understanding compounded.

Same tool. Opposite trajectories. The difference is whether each interaction builds judgment or bypasses it.

## What scales

An individual interaction is small. A career is 80,000 hours. A team of twenty is 1.6 million hours.

The patterns that spread aren't the ones people choose deliberately — they're the defaults. The developer who learned with AI becomes the tech lead who defines code review standards. If their mental model of good review is "does this work?" rather than "do you understand why this works?", that becomes the team's standard. Ten engineers learn under it. Some of them become tech leads. The default propagates because the people who learned under it become the people who set it next.

The baseline established now is the floor for what comes later. Positive compounding raises it. Negative compounding lowers it until the tool becomes load-bearing infrastructure no one can examine.

## The Choice Inside the Compounding

The compounding is real in both directions. Which direction depends on how each interaction goes — not in aggregate, but one at a time.

Generate then comprehend, or accept and move on. Reserve the hard problems for practice, or route everything through the tool. Ask why the AI reached that conclusion, or trust the confidence and ship it.

These aren't expensive choices. They cost four minutes on a 24-minute task. They require framing the interaction as learning rather than completion. Research on mastery orientation found this framing maintained critical thinking at 35.7 times the odds of pure task-completion framing — an effect size large enough to see without statistics.

The foundations being set now compound. That's precisely why the design of these tools matters. An AI that answers directly bypasses the struggle where learning happens. An AI that scaffolds leaves the struggle intact and adds speed. The outcomes diverge across thousands of repetitions.

What today's junior developer internalises becomes what they institutionalise. The trajectory starts now.
