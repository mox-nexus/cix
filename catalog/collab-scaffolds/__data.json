Every scaffold is backed by research evidence from 50+ studies (CHI, PNAS, Lancet, NeurIPS, HICSS). Not tutorials — decision frameworks, metacognitive techniques, trust calibration, and the reasoning behind them.\n\n## When It Activates\n\n- Writing code or making technical decisions\n- Refactoring and code reviews\n- Debugging (especially when stuck)\n- Verifying claims or calibrating trust\n- Any context where quality matters\n\n## What You Get\n\n### The Skill (collab-craft)\n\nCollaborative building methodology grounded in:\n- Software Craftsmanship Manifesto principles\n- Metacognitive scaffolding (Cognitive Mirror, PME friction)\n- Trust calibration (evidence levels, contrastive explanations)\n- Skill preservation (approach crafting, recovery protocols)\n- Evidence-based decision making and verification\n\n### The Agent (Mr. Wolf)\n\n**Structured problem solver.** Gets called when you're stuck, going in circles, or debugging isn't converging.\n\nMr. Wolf:\n1. Stops what isn't working\n2. Clarifies what's actually happening\n3. Identifies the type of problem\n4. Breaks it down systematically\n5. Verifies before declaring solved\n\n### The Hooks (Automatic Assistance)\n\nTwo hooks detect patterns that need intervention:\n\n| Hook | Detects | Response |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| `detect-debugging-loop` | 3+ consecutive failures | Spawns Mr. Wolf |\n| `detect-frustration` | User frustration signals | Spawns Mr. Wolf |\n\n**To disable hooks:** Set environment variable `SKIP_MRWOLF_HOOKS=1`\n\n```bash\nSKIP_MRWOLF_HOOKS=1 claude\n```\n\n## Structure\n\n```\ncollab-scaffolds/\n├── skills/collab-craft/\n│   ├── SKILL.md              # Building methodology (\u003C 500 lines)\n│   └── references/           # Deep dives (11 files)\n│       ├── metacognitive-scaffolding.md  # Cognitive Mirror, PME, HypoCompass\n│       ├── trust-calibration.md          # Evidence levels, contrastive explanations\n│       ├── skill-preservation.md         # Atrophy, recovery, job crafting\n│       ├── productivity-reality.md       # METR RCT, code quality signals\n│       ├── reasoning-scaffolds.md        # Wolf, OODA, hypothesis testing\n│       ├── reasoning-verification.md     # CoVe, Pythea\n│       ├── behavioral-awareness.md       # Collaboration traps\n│       ├── verification-patterns.md      # Code hygiene checklists\n│       ├── kaizen-crystallization.md     # Compound learning\n│       ├── writing-antipatterns.md       # Writing quality\n│       └── principles-and-patterns-examples.md  # Concrete examples\n├── agents/\n│   └── mrwolf.md             # Structured problem solver\n├── hooks/\n│   ├── hooks.json            # Hook configuration\n│   ├── detect-debugging-loop.sh\n│   ├── detect-frustration.sh\n│   └── session-start.sh      # Session transparency\n├── docs/\n│   └── explanation/          # Human-optimized (WHY)\n│       ├── methodology.md    # Research base & design rationale\n│       └── sources.md        # Full bibliography (50+ studies)\n└── scripts/                  # Installation helpers\n```\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**You're not done when it works. You're done when it's right.**\n\nEverything you create becomes part of a system others depend on. Scaffolding, not crutches — temporary support designed to make humans more capable, not dependent.\n",{"agents":13,"skills":13,"hooks":14,"commands":15},1,3,0,"constraint",[]],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
