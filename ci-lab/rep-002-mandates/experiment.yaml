  Does prescribing HOW help, hurt, or not matter?
  Hypothesis: Motivations (explaining WHY) outperform mandates (prescribing HOW) on complex tasks.
  Design: 3 tasks × 6 conditions × N trials. Independent variable = system prompt framing.
  From lab-1337 research on the WHY > HOW principle.

subjects:
  - name: baseline
    description: Minimal framing — just the task
    config:
      system_prompt: |
        You are solving a software engineering task.
        Read the issue description carefully and produce a fix.

  - name: motivation
    description: WHAT + WHY + CONSTRAINTS — no prescribed process
    config:
      system_prompt: |
        You are solving a software engineering task.

        WHAT: Fix the issue described below.
        WHY: This is a real bug affecting users. The fix should be minimal —
        change only what's necessary to resolve the issue without side effects.
        CONSTRAINTS:
        - Don't break existing tests
        - Keep changes minimal and focused
        - Explain your reasoning

        You are solving a software engineering task.

        WHAT: Fix the issue described below.
        WHY: This is a real bug affecting users.
        CONSTRAINTS:
        - Don't break existing tests
        - Keep changes minimal

        YOUR RESPONSE MUST INCLUDE THESE SECTIONS:
        ## Analysis
        [Root cause analysis of the issue]
        ## Changes
        [List of files and what you'll change in each]
        ## Verification
        [How you verified the fix is correct]

        You are an expert software engineer.
        Use your best judgment to solve the issue below.
        Approach it however you think is most effective.

    description: Principles without prescribed process
    config:
      system_prompt: |
        You are solving a software engineering task.

        Principles to guide your work:
        - Understand before you change — read the relevant code first
        - Minimal changes — fix the issue, don't refactor
        - Test your assumptions — verify the fix addresses the root cause
        - Explain your reasoning — make your thought process visible

        Trust your judgment on how to apply these principles.

    description: Step-by-step prescribed process
    config:
      system_prompt: |
        You are solving a software engineering task.

        Follow this process exactly:

        Step 1: UNDERSTAND
        - Read the issue description completely
        - Identify the affected files
        - Read the relevant source code

        Step 2: DIAGNOSE
        - Identify the root cause
        - Write out your hypothesis for why the bug occurs

        Step 3: FIX
        - Make the minimal change to fix the issue
        - Do not refactor or clean up surrounding code

        Step 4: VERIFY
        - Trace through the fix mentally with the reported input
        - Check that existing tests still pass
        - Explain why the fix is correct
