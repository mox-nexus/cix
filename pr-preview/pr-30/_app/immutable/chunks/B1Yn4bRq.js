Your brain processes information differently when AI is available.

---

You've been pair-programming with AI for a week. Pull requests ship faster. Code reviews come back clean. But when you sit down without it — maybe the API is down, or you're debugging on a locked-down production box — something feels different. The solutions don't come as quickly. You reach for patterns that aren't quite there.

This isn't imagination. It's measurable.

## The Offloading Reflex

When AI handles cognitive work, your brain stops performing it. This isn't laziness or skill loss in the traditional sense. It's rational resource allocation. Why activate working memory when an external system provides the answer faster and more reliably?

The problem isn't the offloading itself — it's what doesn't happen during offloading.

Memory encoding requires deep processing. You read a problem, consider approaches, try one, hit an error, diagnose why, adjust your mental model. That sequence — attempt, failure, diagnosis, revision — is what transfers knowledge from working memory to long-term storage.

AI shortcuts the sequence. Problem → AI solution → acceptance. The task completes. The mental model never updates.

MIT researchers measured this neurologically using EEG during AI-assisted writing. <span class="ev ev-weak" title="Kosmyna et al. 2025, arXiv preprint, n=54, published critique">○</span> Neural connectivity in memory encoding regions systematically scaled down. After the task, 83% of participants couldn't recall quotes from essays they'd just written. They didn't forget. They never learned. The encoding step was skipped entirely.

## The Confidence-Competence Inversion

Here's the counterintuitive part: making AI more trustworthy can make outcomes worse.

A study of 319 knowledge workers found two types of confidence during AI collaboration. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="CHI peer-reviewed, n=319, structural equation modeling">●</span>

**AI-confidence** — trust that the AI's output is correct. This predicted *less* critical thinking. The correlation was strong: β = -0.69. When you trust the AI, you stop checking its work.

**Self-confidence** — trust that you can evaluate the output. This predicted *more* critical thinking: β = +0.35. When you trust your judgment, you engage with what the AI produces.

The inversion happens when these two move in opposite directions. As AI gets better, AI-confidence rises (rational — it's producing better outputs). But if self-confidence stays flat or drops (also rational — "why would I second-guess something this good?"), critical thinking collapses.

Better AI. Less thinking. Worse outcomes.

The most striking finding: a skeptical user with mediocre AI can outperform a credulous user with state-of-the-art AI. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="PNAS Nexus theoretical model with empirical support">◐</span> Human metacognition matters more than model accuracy. If you're not checking the work, errors propagate regardless of how rare they are.

## What Gets Lost

Task performance improves. That's consistent across studies. But performance on the task isn't the same as learning from the task.

Researchers documented what they called "smarter but none the wiser" — AI users showed better immediate results without improving their understanding of the domain. Performance metrics went up. Metacognitive calibration stayed flat.

The mechanism: AI removes errors. Errors force diagnosis. Diagnosis builds mental models.

In one study, developers learning a new framework encountered a median of 3 errors without AI assistance. With AI that delegated the implementation entirely, they encountered 1 error. They finished faster and learned nothing about why their code didn't work. The errors were the curriculum. Removing them removed the learning.

This explains why you can feel productive while getting less capable. The deliverables ship. The understanding doesn't compound.

## The Countermeasure: Metacognitive Friction

If the problem is bypassing cognitive engagement, the solution is reintroducing it deliberately.

Three-phase friction works: Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation.

**Planning**: Before the AI assists, articulate your approach. "What's your plan?" This preserves the generative step — the moment where you'd normally activate domain knowledge.

**Monitoring**: During execution, check alignment. "Does this match your expectations?" This maintains engagement instead of passive observation.

**Evaluation**: After completion, reflect. "What would you change?" This crystallizes learning that would otherwise dissipate.

Research shows all three phases are necessary. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="CHI peer-reviewed controlled experiment">●</span> Single-point friction (just asking for a plan, or just asking for review) was insufficient. The full cycle restores the critical thinking that AI-confidence suppresses.

Each phase targets a different failure mode:
- Planning prevents pure delegation
- Monitoring prevents blind acceptance
- Evaluation prevents finishing without learning

## When Offloading Makes Sense

Not all cognitive offloading is harmful. Working memory is limited. Offloading routine details to focus on higher-level reasoning is the point of abstraction.

The distinction: offload what you've mastered, engage with what you're learning.

Routine syntax, formatting, boilerplate patterns you've internalized — offload these. They're not where learning happens. Architectural decisions, security reasoning, novel implementations — these are where capability compounds. Shortcutting them trades short-term speed for long-term capacity.

The question to ask: "Is this something I need to get better at, or something I've already mastered?" If the former, resist the offload reflex.

## The Design Imperative

If you're building AI tools, the research implications are clear:

**Reduce AI-confidence signals**. Don't project false certainty. Show reasoning, acknowledge uncertainty, invite verification. The goal isn't to make AI seem unreliable — it's to maintain human engagement.

**Boost self-confidence signals**. Affirm the human's ability to evaluate. "You have context I lack" or "Your judgment here is critical" shifts authority back where metacognition lives.

**Make reasoning transparent**. Humans can evaluate logic chains. They struggle with opaque outputs. Show the steps, not just the answer.

**Preserve the generative step** in learning contexts. Let the human attempt first, or require active comprehension questions if AI generates first. Engagement matters more than who typed.

## What We Don't Know

No longitudinal study tracks developer capability over years of AI use. We have three-month medical studies showing 20% skill degradation. We have cross-sectional data on perception gaps. But the multi-year trajectory in software development remains unmeasured.

The closest measured analog: after AI-assisted colonoscopy was introduced, endoscopists' unaided detection rate declined 20% on their non-AI cases (Budzyń et al. Lancet 2025, multicentre observational, 19 endoscopists). Cognitive mechanisms are likely similar — perceptual and reasoning skills both require practice. Remove practice, lose proficiency.

But software development involves more abstract reasoning than perceptual detection. Whether cognitive offloading produces faster or slower capability loss is still speculative.

The research we need: cohort studies tracking unassisted capability over 2-5 years of varied AI use. Until that exists, we're inferring from adjacent domains and short-term experiments.

## The Pattern

AI collaboration changes cognition measurably. Confidence in AI suppresses critical thinking. Memory encoding fails during cognitive offloading. Performance improves while metacognition stays flat. Human skepticism provides error correction that model accuracy alone cannot.

The pattern is consistent: substitutive use degrades thinking. Complementary use that maintains engagement preserves capability.

The cognitive mechanisms are understood. The design implications are clear. Your brain processes differently with AI. The question is whether you're designing for preserved capability or optimized throughput.

`,Mc=`# Collaboration Design

What makes AI collaboration actually work — and why most systems get it wrong.

---

You're reviewing an AI's recommendation: "Use Redis for this cache." It sounds reasonable. You ship it. Three months later, you're debugging why cache invalidation is broken. The AI never mentioned that Redis persistence modes interact badly with your replication setup. You trusted because it sounded authoritative. The AI delivered with confidence. Neither of you verified.

This failure is baked into the design. Most AI systems optimize for engagement and confidence — the exact features that research shows backfire. Meanwhile, the two strongest levers (control and transparency) get sacrificed for "better user experience."

Here's what actually works.

## The Two Levers That Matter

After experiments with 654 professionals, researchers found two factors dominate everything else:

**Control** (β = 0.507) — You shape the direction. You make the decisions. You retain agency over the collaboration.

**Transparency** (β = 0.415) — The system shows its reasoning. Surfaces its assumptions. Explains how it reached conclusions. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Blaurock et al. 2025, scenario experiments, n=654">◐</span>

Everything else shows smaller effects or actively backfires. And here's the kicker: adding engagement features — gamification, personalization, social elements — measurably reduces trust (b = -0.555). Each feature you add for "better UX" degrades the collaboration. Users want control and understanding, not friction disguised as interaction.

## Framing Changes Everything

Watch what happens when you shift from prescription to comparison:

| Framing | Cognitive Mode |
|---------|----------------|
| "Use Redis for this cache." | Heuristic acceptance |
| "Redis instead of Memcached because you need data structures beyond key-value. If you only need simple caching, Memcached would be simpler and faster." | Analytic evaluation |

Same recommendation. Different frame. Completely different cognitive response.

The contrastive version shows alternatives were considered, makes tradeoffs visible, and activates comparison rather than acceptance. It teaches the decision framework, not just the decision. The technique is trivial to implement but fundamentally changes the relationship. Prescription invites blind trust. Contrast invites evaluation.

## Why Over How

A security study compared two teaching approaches:

- Prescribe HOW: "Always use prepared statements for SQL queries." Result: 30% wrote secure code.
- Explain WHY: "SQL injection occurs when user input is treated as code. Prepared statements separate data from code. Consider where untrusted input enters your query." Result: 80% wrote secure code.

**2.5x improvement from explaining motivation rather than mandating method.**

The mechanism is clear: HOW prescriptions create brittle rules applied in narrow contexts. WHY explanations build transferable frameworks that generalize. When you understand the reasoning, you can adapt to new situations. When you only know the rule, you can't recognize when it applies.

This pattern holds beyond security. Teaching frameworks beats providing solutions.

## How Expertise Changes the Game

Stack Overflow's 2025 survey revealed a paradox: senior developers trust AI output least (2.5%) but ship the most AI-generated code to production (32%). Junior developers trust more (17%) but ship less (13%).

Why? Seniors treat AI output like a first draft from a junior colleague — they read carefully, check edge cases, verify against production constraints, refactor for codebase patterns. They verify because they can evaluate. That editing is where the verification happens. The verification is where learning happens. The learning is what prevents dependency.

Juniors trust more precisely because they lack the judgment to evaluate. Higher trust correlates with less verification, which means errors propagate. The trust itself becomes dangerous.

**The design implication:** Systems optimized for seniors (who verify regardless) fail juniors (who need scaffolding). If you're building AI collaboration tools, design for juniors who need:

- Explicit verification prompts before accepting
- Assumptions surfaced in every generation
- "What could go wrong" sections
- Encouragement to edit, not just accept

## Calibrated Confidence

When AI presents everything with equal certainty, you can't calibrate trust or allocate verification effort appropriately. Uniform confidence is harmful.

Here's what calibrated looks like:

**Strong confidence:** "Connection pooling improves throughput — this is well-established across PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle documentation."

**Moderate confidence:** "The Bastani PNAS study found 17% learning harm from unrestricted AI use, but that was in math education. Transfer to software development is plausible but not directly measured."

**Speculative:** "This pattern might cause issues at scale, but I'm reasoning by analogy to similar systems. Verify with load testing in your environment."

Gradated confidence enables verification effort to match risk. Binary confidence (always certain OR always hedging) prevents calibration entirely.

## The Counter-Argument Pattern

Before presenting any recommendation, search for the strongest evidence against it. Then present both.

Instead of: "Use PostgreSQL for this use case."

Try: "I recommend PostgreSQL. Strongest argument against: your write pattern (10K inserts/sec) could hit WAL bottlenecks. If writes dominate, Cassandra would handle this better. Why I still recommend PostgreSQL: your read pattern needs complex joins that Cassandra can't do, and you can shard writes with Citus if needed."

This forces genuine evaluation before advocating, surfaces failure modes before they happen, and teaches the decision framework. The reader learns how to evaluate, not just what to choose.

## The Confidence Trap

Research shows AI confidence negatively correlates with your critical thinking (β = -0.69). The more you trust AI, the less you verify it. But self-confidence in your own judgment positively correlates (β = +0.35). Trust in yourself increases engagement. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Lee et al. CHI 2025, n=319">●</span>

The design response: reduce AI-confidence signals, boost self-confidence signals.

Compare these:

❌ "The answer is X." (boosts AI-confidence, reduces your engagement)

✅ "Based on what I see, X seems right — but you have the production context I lack. What does your experience suggest?" (boosts self-confidence, increases engagement)

Small language shift. Opposite cognitive effect.

## The Mirror Pattern

Instead of answering directly, reflect the question back with structured prompts:

**Substitutive:** "Should I use Redis or PostgreSQL for caching?" → "Use Redis, it's faster for caching."

**Cognitive mirror:** "You're thinking about caching. Let me reflect what I see: read-heavy workload from your earlier analysis, durability matters for this data, already running PostgreSQL. What's driving the instinct toward Redis specifically? What happens if the cache goes down — is that acceptable?"

The mirror forces you to articulate implicit reasoning, evaluate your own logic, and discover gaps in your analysis. You build transferable frameworks instead of receiving point solutions.

## Trust Gradients

Not all AI output needs the same verification depth:

| Output Type | Verification Level |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Formatting, syntax | Quick glance |
| Library usage, API calls | Check docs for edge cases |
| Business logic | Full review against requirements |
| Security-sensitive code | Dedicated security review |
| Architecture decisions | Multiple perspectives |

Uniform trust (accept everything / reject everything) wastes effort or misses critical errors. Calibrated trust allocates verification where risk concentrates.

Here's a useful metric: track how often you edit AI suggestions. Less than 5% edits signals under-reviewing (automation bias risk). More than 50% edits means AI isn't effective for this task. The healthy range is 10-30% — you're genuinely evaluating, catching real issues, but the AI is still providing value.

## The Inversion Insight

One study found that a skeptical user with mediocre AI outperforms a credulous user with state-of-the-art AI. Human metacognitive sensitivity matters more than model accuracy.

This means optimizing model quality has diminishing returns if users don't engage critically. Design priorities should be:

1. Maintaining skepticism over increasing AI confidence
2. Surfacing uncertainty over projecting authority
3. Inviting verification over providing answers
4. Building metacognitive habits over polishing outputs

When your AI is highly confident, that's exactly when to be most careful about presentation. High-confidence presentation triggers low engagement, which creates fragile outcomes.

## Verification Decay

Trust calibration degrades without maintenance. The pattern is predictable:

- Day 1: Carefully review every suggestion
- Day 7: Skim, spot-check occasionally
- Day 30: Accept if it "looks right"
- Day 90: Auto-accept until things break

Why? Verification is cognitively expensive. Most output is correct (which reinforces skipping). There's no feedback for undetected errors. Time pressure favors speed.

Counter this with structure:

- Keep a verification checklist (under 30 seconds, applied consistently)
- Do spot audits (randomly deep-verify even when confident)
- Run red team rotations (assume output is wrong, try to find the error)
- Track your catch rate (if you never catch issues, verify harder)

## The Design Choice

The research converges on a clear pattern: control and transparency dominate. Simple techniques (contrastive framing, calibrated confidence, explaining WHY over prescribing HOW) produce outsized effects. Engagement features backfire.

The senior-junior gap reveals the underlying mechanism: seniors verify because they can evaluate. Juniors need scaffolding to learn how. Design for building judgment, not bypassing it.

Same tools, different interaction patterns, opposite outcomes. You can design for compounding capability or compounding dependency. The mechanisms are known. The evidence is clear. The implementation is straightforward.

What remains is intention.

`,Hc=`# Diversity & Conformity

AI makes everyone better. AI makes everyone the same. Both are true.

---

## The Paradox in Practice

Your team of five developers all use Claude to write code. Over six months, code quality improves—fewer bugs, clearer naming, better test coverage. Individual performance reviews are stellar. But something else happens that metrics don't capture: the team loses its problem-solving range.

Before AI, Alex approached architecture through data flow diagrams. Jordan thought in state machines. Sam sketched on whiteboards. Taylor wrote prose specifications. Each perspective caught different problems. When a gnarly concurrency bug appeared, the team had five different lenses to diagnose it.

After six months with AI, they still have five developers. But the approaches converge. Everyone structures code similarly. Everyone writes comparable tests. Everyone reaches for the same patterns. Not because AI forced uniformity—because AI suggestions became the team's shared starting point. Individual code got better. Collective problem-solving range narrowed.

When a novel architectural challenge appears—one that doesn't fit the patterns AI learned from training data—the team struggles. Not from lack of skill. From lack of diverse approaches. Five developers, one search strategy.

## The Evidence Is Unambiguous

Jiang et al. tested 70+ language models on 26,000 open-ended queries. The finding: convergence regardless of model architecture. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="NeurIPS Best Paper, 70+ models, 26,000 queries">●</span> GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Gemini—different companies, different training, same output clusters. When asked for "a metaphor about time," 25 models produced only 2 dominant response types.

The mechanism is RLHF—Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. Training optimizes for consensus. Valid but idiosyncratic responses get penalized. Temperature settings don't help. The convergence happens during training, not generation.

Doshi & Hauser quantified the social dilemma precisely: individual novelty +8.1%, collective similarity +10.7%. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Science Advances, controlled experiment">●</span> Each person is better off using AI. Collectively, the diversity that enables innovation disappears.

A meta-analysis of 28 studies (n=8,214) confirmed this across domains: **g = -0.863 diversity reduction**—one of the largest negative effects in the creativity literature. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Meta-analysis, 28 studies, n=8,214, p<0.001">●</span>

## Why Diversity Matters

Hong & Page proved mathematically that diverse groups outperform best-ability homogeneous groups on complex problems. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="PNAS, formal proof + simulation">●</span> The mechanism isn't about individual skill—it's about solution space coverage. Diverse perspectives explore different paths. Homogeneous groups search the same regions repeatedly.

Their theorem: "Diversity trumps ability." Not always. But in complex domains with large solution spaces—which describes most interesting problems—diverse search beats focused excellence.

This has direct software implications. If everyone using AI converges toward similar architectural patterns, the collective capacity to handle novel challenges degrades. Individual code quality improves while systemic problem-solving range contracts.

## The Systemic Requirement

W. Ross Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety states: only variety can destroy variety. A control system must possess at least as much internal variety as the disturbances it encounters.

Applied to cognition: if problems are varied but solutions are homogeneous, the system cannot adapt. You need diverse approaches to handle diverse challenges.

AI homogenization violates this principle. Problems remain varied—new technologies, novel requirements, emergent failures. But if everyone's approach converges, the system loses requisite variety. When a disturbance hits outside the common solution space, everyone fails simultaneously.

## The Financial Parallel

Andy Haldane analyzed the 2008 crisis as monoculture collapse. By 2008, hedge fund strategies showed correlation of ~0.35. Everyone optimized for the same signals—subprime risk was mispriced, leverage was cheap, housing would rise.

When housing prices fell, strategies that worked independently failed together. Correlation during crisis approached 1.0. No diversity to absorb the shock.

Haldane's conclusion: "Finance has a natural tendency toward monoculture. And monoculture, in finance as in agriculture, creates vulnerability to catastrophic risk."

The parallel isn't precise—software doesn't crash globally like markets. But the principle holds. Shared patterns create shared vulnerabilities. A problem that exploits common approaches affects everyone simultaneously.

## Cultural Erasure

Agarwal et al. trained classifiers to distinguish cultural origin in writing. Baseline accuracy: 90.6%. With AI assistance: 83.5%. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="CHI peer-reviewed, classification study">●</span>

Non-Western writers using AI sound more Western. Not through choice—through statistical convergence toward dominant training patterns. This isn't preference. It's erasure. The quiet kind, where everyone becomes individually better at communicating while collectively losing distinct voices.

At scale: cultural patterns become statistically rarer. Ways of thinking outside the dominant mode get filtered out. Novel ideas that don't fit existing patterns are less likely to emerge. Dominant groups already have more training data representation. AI reinforces that dominance. The feedback loop is self-reinforcing.

## Why the Mechanism Is Structural

AI doesn't cause homogenization through poor design. It's a natural consequence of how the technology works.

Training on consensus: Models learn from what people wrote. RLHF optimizes for what human raters prefer. Both favor consensus over idiosyncrasy. The model learns "write something typical," not "write something distinctive."

Anchoring effects: When AI suggests an answer, users anchor to it. Even with modifications, the starting point shapes the final result. Over millions of interactions, outputs cluster around AI suggestions.

Iterative reinforcement: As AI-generated content enters training data, future models train on homogenized outputs, further reinforcing convergence. This isn't a bug to fix. It's a property of statistical learning from shared distributions.

## The Compounding Risk

One person using AI doesn't threaten diversity. A billion people using the same AI, anchoring to the same suggestions, internalizing the same patterns—that changes the distribution of human thought.

The first-order effect is measurable now: g = -0.863 diversity reduction.

The second-order effect is speculative but plausible: as AI-homogenized content becomes training data for future models, convergence accelerates. Users trained in an AI-saturated environment learn AI patterns as baseline. Defaults shift. What was once idiosyncratic becomes incomprehensible. The center of gravity moves, and diversity relative to that center shrinks.

## Not Inevitable

Wan & Kalman showed that using 10 diverse AI personas eliminated the homogenization effect. Users exposed to multiple personas maintained diversity comparable to no-AI baseline. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Single study, promising but needs replication">◐</span>

The mechanism: diverse starting points prevent anchoring to a single mode. Users synthesize across suggestions rather than accepting one.

This demonstrates homogenization is design-dependent, not inherent. The problem is using the same AI the same way at scale. The solution is structural variety—multiple models or deliberate output diversification.

Other protective measures:
- **Attempt-first protocols**: Generate solutions before consulting AI to avoid anchoring
- **Divergent prompting**: Explicitly request unusual responses
- **Source diversity**: Train on underrepresented data to reduce bias

None of these are expensive. They require intentionality.

## The Stakes

Diversity isn't aesthetic preference. It's systemic requirement. Complex systems need variety to handle disturbances. Collective intelligence requires diverse perspectives. Monocultures are fragile.

AI homogenization threatens this at scale. Individual quality rising while collective diversity collapses. The effect size (g = -0.863) is among the largest observed in the creativity literature. Adoption is accelerating. Mitigation exists but isn't deployed at scale.

The question is whether design changes in time to preserve what makes collective intelligence work: the variety, the idiosyncrasy, the perspectives that don't fit the statistical mode but turn out to be exactly what's needed when the disturbance comes.

If AI makes everyone better while making everyone the same, we gain individual capability while losing collective resilience. That's not progress. That's trading the foundation for the scaffolding.

## Part 1: What Is Evaluation, Really?

### The Simple Case (That Doesn't Exist)

Imagine you're testing a function that adds two numbers:

\`\`\`python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

assert add(2, 3) == 5  # Pass or fail. Done.
\`\`\`

This is testing, not evaluation. The correct answer is unambiguous, deterministic, and instant to verify.

**LLM evaluation is never this simple.** Here's why.

### The Reality: Non-Determinism, Judgment, and Cost

When you ask Claude to write code, fix a bug, or answer a question, three problems emerge:

**Problem 1: Non-Determinism**
Run the same prompt twice, get different outputs. Even with \`temperature=0\`, outputs vary. How do you measure quality when the answer changes?

**Problem 2: Judgment Over Correctness**
There's often no single "correct" answer. A bug fix might work but be inelegant. A summary might be accurate but miss the key point. Who decides what's "good"?

**Problem 3: Cost-Quality Tradeoffs**
An agent might get the right answer after 500 API calls costing $12. Another gets 90% accuracy in 3 calls costing $0.02. Which is better? It depends on your use case.

**This is why evaluation is hard.** You're not checking correctness — you're measuring quality, consistency, and cost across distributions of outcomes.

## Part 2: The Four Dimensions Every Framework Must Handle

### Dimension 1: State — Does Anything Persist Between Steps?

Consider evaluating a multi-step debugging agent:

1. Agent reads error message
2. Agent searches codebase for the bug
3. Agent proposes a fix
4. Agent runs tests
5. Agent iterates if tests fail

At step 3, the agent needs to remember what it found at step 2. That's **shared state**.

**Most frameworks treat each test as independent.** They can't check "does skill B interfere with skill A?" because they have no way to track whether adding B changed A's internal state.

**Only Inspect AI has a true state mechanism** (the \`store\`, a Pydantic model passed through the solver chain). Every other framework reviewed treats samples as independent.

**Why this matters for ix**: ix needs to measure skill coexistence ("adding skill B breaks skill A") and context degradation ("agent performance drops after 50 tool calls"). Both require tracking state across a session.

**Source**: LLM Framework Landscape report, "State Model" comparison matrix

---

### Dimension 2: Execution — How Are Tests Run?

You have 1,000 test cases. Do you run them:
- One at a time (slow, but simple)
- All at once (fast, but overwhelms API rate limits)
- In batches of 20 (balanced, but requires orchestration)

And within a single test case with multiple graders, do you:
- Run graders sequentially (A, then B, then C)
- Run graders in parallel (A, B, C at the same time)
- Run graders as a dependency graph (B depends on A's output, C depends on both)

**Example**: You're evaluating a RAG system. You need to:
1. Check retrieval quality (did it fetch relevant documents?)
2. Check answer accuracy (is the generated answer correct?)
3. Compute a composite F1 score from #1 and #2

If graders run sequentially, this takes 3 LLM calls. If they run as a DAG, graders 1 and 2 can run in parallel, then grader 3 computes F1 from their results. That's 2 LLM calls instead of 3.

**Most frameworks run sequentially.** DeepEval has a "DAG metric" (internal to a single metric), but no framework supports DAG orchestration across multiple metrics.

**Why this matters for ix**: ix's probe-sensor-grader-scorer pipeline is inherently a DAG. Probes generate stimuli, sensors observe responses, graders score observations, scorers aggregate across trials. These should compose as a dependency graph, not a linear chain.

**Source**: LLM Framework Landscape report, "Execution Model" comparison matrix

---

### Dimension 3: Stochastic Handling — What Do You Do About Randomness?

Run the same prompt 10 times. You get 7 correct answers and 3 wrong ones. What's your score?

**Naive answer**: 70% accuracy.

**Better question**: What's your confidence interval? If you ran 10 more trials, would you get 60%? 80%? You need error bars.

**Even better question**: Does "one success out of 10 trials" matter, or do you need consistent success? These are different metrics:

- **pass@k**: Probability of at least one success in k trials. Use for code generation tools (one working solution is enough).
- **pass^k**: Probability that all k trials succeed. Use for customer-facing agents (consistency matters).

**Example**: An agent succeeds 75% of the time.
- pass@3 = "at least one success in 3 tries" = 1 - (0.25)^3 = **98.4%**
- pass^3 = "all 3 tries succeed" = (0.75)^3 = **42.2%**

Same agent, wildly different performance depending on your metric.

**Only two frameworks handle stochasticity properly:**
1. **Inspect AI**: \`epochs\` parameter runs multiple trials per task, \`reducers\` aggregate scores, bootstrap computes standard errors
2. **LM Harness**: \`bootstrap_iters\` for confidence intervals

**Every other framework** says "run it again and compare manually."

**Why this matters for ix**: Without proper stochastic handling, you can't tell if a 3-point score improvement is signal or noise. Anthropic's research shows infrastructure configuration alone shifts scores by 6 percentage points — larger than most "improvements" you'll measure.

- [Anthropic "Demystifying Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents) — pass@k vs pass^k

---

### Dimension 4: Grading — Who Decides What's Good?

You have an agent that summarized a document. Is the summary good? Three approaches:

**Code-based grading** (deterministic):
- Exact match: \`output == expected_output\`
- ROUGE score: Overlap between output and reference
- JSON validity: \`json.loads(output)\` succeeds

**Pros**: Fast, cheap, objective, reproducible
**Cons**: Brittle to valid variations, lacks nuance

**Model-based grading** (LLM-as-judge):
- Give Claude a rubric: "Rate this summary 1-5 on accuracy, clarity, conciseness"
- Claude grades the output
- You get scores with reasoning

**Pros**: Flexible, scalable, captures nuance
**Cons**: Non-deterministic, more expensive, requires calibration

**Human grading**:
- Expert reads output, assigns score
- Gold standard quality

**Pros**: Most accurate
**Cons**: Expensive ($50-200/hour), slow, doesn't scale

**Anthropic's hierarchy** (use the highest tier feasible):
1. Code-based (if deterministic correctness exists)
2. LLM-based (for nuance and subjective quality)
3. Human (for calibration and spot-checks only)

**Critical insight from Anthropic**: "Grade what the agent produced, not the path it took." Don't check for specific tool call sequences — agents find valid approaches designers didn't anticipate.

**Example**: You're evaluating a bug-fixing agent. Don't check "did it call \`git blame\`, then \`grep\`, then \`edit\`?" Instead check "did it fix the bug?" The agent might use \`rg\` instead of \`grep\`, or skip \`git blame\` entirely. That's fine.

## Part 3: The Statistical Problem Everyone Ignores

### Why Your 5-Point Improvement Might Be Noise

You run a measurement. Your agent scores 73%. You make a change. It scores 78%. Success?

**Maybe. Maybe not.**

Here's what you need to know:

**1. You Measured a Sample, Not the Universe**

Your 1,000-question suite is a sample from an infinite universe of possible questions. The 73% you measured is an estimate of the true mean. How good is that estimate?

Enter the **Standard Error of the Mean (SEM)**:

\`\`\`
SEM = standard_deviation / sqrt(n)
\`\`\`

For 1,000 questions with std=0.45, SEM = 0.45 / sqrt(1000) = **0.014** (1.4 percentage points).

Your **95% confidence interval** is:

\`\`\`
73% +/- 1.96 x 1.4% = 73% +/- 2.7% = [70.3%, 75.7%]
\`\`\`

After your change, you scored 78%. That's outside the confidence interval. **Probably real.**

But if you scored 75%? That's [72.3%, 77.7%], which overlaps with the original interval. **Might be noise.**

**2. Your Questions Might Be Correlated**

Imagine you're measuring reading comprehension. You have 10 questions about one passage. A model that misunderstands the passage gets all 10 wrong. These questions are **not independent**.

Standard error assumes independence. If questions cluster (reading comp, SQL injection, etc.), naive SEM **underestimates uncertainty by up to 3x**.

You need **clustered standard errors**:

\`\`\`python
# Naive SEM (wrong if clustered)
sem_naive = np.std(scores) / np.sqrt(len(scores))

# Clustered SEM (correct)
cluster_means = df.groupby('cluster_id')['score'].mean()
sem_clustered = np.std(cluster_means) / np.sqrt(len(cluster_means))
\`\`\`

**Evan Miller's research** (Anthropic) found clustered SEs **3x larger** than naive calculations on benchmarks like DROP and SQuAD.

**3. Infrastructure Noise Is Real**

From Anthropic's infrastructure noise research (Feb 2026):

- Changing from 1x to 3x resource headroom shifts scores by **3.7 percentage points** (p < 0.001)
- Changing Docker config shifts scores by **6 percentage points** (p < 0.01)

**Recommendation**: "Leaderboard differences below 3 percentage points deserve skepticism without documented matching configurations."

**Your 5-point improvement might actually be 2 points of signal + 3 points of infrastructure noise.**

**4. Paired Comparisons Are More Powerful**

When comparing two models/agents on the same questions, don't just compare their means. Use **paired differences**:

\`\`\`python
differences = scores_after - scores_before
mean_diff = np.mean(differences)
se_diff = np.std(differences) / np.sqrt(len(differences))
ci_diff = mean_diff +/- 1.96 * se_diff
\`\`\`

Why? Models correlate on questions (r=0.3-0.7 on frontier measurements). Paired tests exploit that correlation for **free variance reduction**.

**Source**:

- [Anthropic "Infrastructure Noise"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/infrastructure-noise) — 6pp config shifts, 3pp skepticism threshold

---

### The CLT Is Dead for Small-N Measurements

The **Central Limit Theorem** says sample means are normally distributed for large N. Most statistics textbooks teach this.

For LLM measurements with N < 100, **the CLT underestimates uncertainty**. A 2025 ICML Spotlight paper ("Don't Use the CLT") proves this empirically across 12 benchmarks.

**The fix**: Use Bayesian methods. The \`bayes_evals\` library provides drop-in replacements for CLT-based confidence intervals.

\`\`\`python
# Wrong (CLT, underestimates uncertainty)
from scipy import stats
ci = stats.norm.interval(0.95, loc=mean, scale=sem)

# Right (Bayesian, correct uncertainty)
from bayes_evals import bayesian_ci
ci = bayesian_ci(scores, confidence=0.95)
\`\`\`

**Why this matters**: ix will run measurements with 20-50 tasks (Anthropic's recommended starting point). The CLT breaks down completely at that scale. Bayesian methods are essential.

**Source**:
- ["Don't Use the CLT"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01747) — ICML 2025 Spotlight

## Part 4: What Frameworks Actually Exist

Now that you understand the hard parts, let's survey the landscape. I'll focus on what each framework is **actually good at**, not marketing claims.

### Category 1: Frameworks That Drive Tests (Build Your Own)

These are libraries/CLIs for defining and running evaluations.

#### Inspect AI (UK AI Safety Institute)

**What it's best at**: Agent measurement with sandboxing and reproducibility

**Architecture**:
- **Dataset**: Test cases
- **Solver**: Chain of operations (simple LLM call to complex agent)
- **Scorer**: Grading logic
- **TaskState + store**: Shared state across solver chain (unique among frameworks)

**Key capabilities**:
- **Agent Bridge**: Drives external agents (Claude Code, LangChain, etc.) in Docker/K8s sandboxes
- **Epochs**: First-class multi-trial support with reducers and bootstrap stderr
- **SWE-bench integration**: Run Claude Code on SWE-bench in containers

**Stochastic handling**: Best-in-class (epochs + reducers + bootstrap)

**Why it's relevant to ix**: Inspect is the strongest existing foundation for agent measurement. Its TaskState + store is the only shared state mechanism. Its Agent Bridge shows how to drive Claude Code programmatically in isolated environments.

**Source**:
- [Inspect AI docs](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/)
- Agent Harness Landscape report, "Inspect AI" section

---

#### Promptfoo

**What it's best at**: Declarative YAML test definitions, red-teaming, CI/CD integration

**Architecture**:
- YAML config defines providers, prompts, test cases, assertions
- CLI runs matrix measurement (every prompt x every provider x every test)
- Built-in red-teaming (OWASP, NIST, MITRE ATLAS)

**Key capabilities**:
- **Claude Agent SDK provider**: Dedicated integration for driving Claude Code sessions
- **Assertions**: string match, regex, LLM-as-judge, cost, latency, ROUGE, BLEU, custom Python/JS
- **Side-effect management**: Serial execution, hooks for env reset between trials

**Stochastic handling**: Basic (\`--repeat N\`, but no CIs)

**Why it's relevant to ix**: Anthropic uses Promptfoo internally for product measurements. Its YAML format could serve as a user-facing test definition layer for ix.

**Source**:
- [Promptfoo docs](https://www.promptfoo.dev/)
- [Anthropic "Demystifying Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents) — "Anthropic uses a version for product evals"

---

#### DeepEval

**What it's best at**: pytest-style testing with 50+ built-in metrics

**Architecture**:
- Test cases as Python code (\`@pytest.mark.deepeval\`)
- 50+ metrics (RAG, safety, conversational, agent)
- Optional cloud platform (Confident AI) for dataset management

**Key capabilities**:
- **DAG metric**: Deterministic LLM-powered decision trees (most powerful metric in the ecosystem)
- **pytest integration**: Familiar to Python developers
- **Concurrent execution**: \`max_concurrent=20\` by default

**Stochastic handling**: None (but DAG metrics are deterministic by design)

**Why it's relevant to ix**: The DAG metric concept (composing LLM calls as a decision tree) is architecturally significant. It shows how to make LLM-based grading deterministic.

**Source**:
- [DeepEval docs](https://deepeval.com/)
- LLM Framework Landscape report, "DeepEval" section

---

#### LM Harness (EleutherAI)

**What it's best at**: Academic benchmarks (MMLU, HellaSwag, etc.)

**Architecture**:
- 60+ benchmarks, hundreds of subtasks
- Unified interface across HuggingFace, vLLM, APIs
- Backend for HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard

**Key capabilities**:
- **Bootstrap stderr**: Mature statistical handling
- **Task versioning**: Reproducibility of previously reported scores
- **Multi-backend**: HuggingFace, vLLM, SGLang, OpenAI, Anthropic

**Stochastic handling**: Excellent (bootstrap_iters for CIs)

**Why it's relevant to ix**: Gold standard for model-level benchmarking. If ix ever needs to compare base model capabilities, LM Harness is the reference.

**Source**:
- [LM Harness docs](https://www.eleuther.ai/artifacts/lm-evaluation-harness)
- LLM Framework Landscape report, "LM Harness" section

---

### Category 2: Platforms That Observe + Measure (SaaS or Self-Hosted)

These combine tracing/observability with measurement. You instrument your code, they collect traces, you run tests against datasets.

#### Langfuse (Open Source)

**What it's best at**: Self-hosted observability + measurement

**Architecture**:
- Trace-based (traces, generations, spans, events)
- PostgreSQL backend (self-hostable Docker/K8s)
- Scores attach to traces

**Key capabilities**:
- **Most-starred** in category (21.7k GitHub stars)
- **Open-source** with full data ownership
- **50+ integrations** (LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, Anthropic)

**Stochastic handling**: Via experiment comparison (manual)

**Why it's relevant to ix**: If ix needs observability, Langfuse is the best self-hosted option. But ix is an experimentation platform, not an observability tool.

**Source**:
- [Langfuse docs](https://langfuse.com/)
- LLM Framework Landscape report, "Langfuse" section

---

#### Arize Phoenix

**What it's best at**: OpenTelemetry-based observability

**Architecture**:
- OTEL traces/spans with auto-instrumentation
- SQLite (dev) or PostgreSQL (prod)
- Runs anywhere (local, Docker, K8s, cloud)

**Key capabilities**:
- **Open-source** (Elastic License 2.0, no feature gates)
- **20x speedup** with built-in concurrency
- **Pre-built scorers**: hallucination, toxicity, relevance

**Stochastic handling**: Via experiment comparison (manual)

**Why it's relevant to ix**: Phoenix shows how to integrate measurement with OTEL tracing. If ix produces traces, Phoenix could ingest them.

**Source**:
- [Arize Phoenix docs](https://phoenix.arize.com/)
- LLM Framework Landscape report, "Arize Phoenix" section

---

#### Braintrust (Proprietary SaaS)

**What it's best at**: CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions

**Architecture**:
- Experiments are the core organizational unit
- Git-like diffing for experiment comparison
- AutoScorers library (open-source scoring)

**Key capabilities**:
- **GitHub Actions**: Block PRs if metrics regress
- **Loop AI**: Generates custom scorers from natural language
- **AutoScorers**: Levenshtein, BLEU, LLM-as-judge, pairwise

**Stochastic handling**: Via experiment comparison (manual)

**Why it's relevant to ix**: Braintrust shows the CI/CD pattern (quality gates, PR blocking). ix should support this.

**Source**:
- [Braintrust docs](https://www.braintrust.dev/)
- LLM Framework Landscape report, "Braintrust" section

---

### Category 3: Benchmarks (Measure Specific Capabilities)

These aren't frameworks — they're datasets with harnesses.

#### SWE-bench (Princeton)

**What it measures**: Real-world GitHub bug fixes

**Architecture**:
- 2,294 tasks from 12 Python repos (original)
- 500 human-verified subset (Verified)
- Dockerized harness: apply patch, run FAIL_TO_PASS + PASS_TO_PASS tests

**Current performance**: ~75% on Verified (Jan 2026)

**Why it's relevant to ix**: SWE-bench is the de facto standard for coding agent measurement. Inspect AI has SWE-bench integration. ix should too.

**Source**:
- [SWE-bench paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06770)
- Agent Harness Landscape report, "SWE-bench Family" section

---

#### WebArena / AgentBench / GAIA

**What they measure**:
- **WebArena**: Web agent tasks (e-commerce, forums, code)
- **AgentBench**: 8 environments (OS, database, gaming, embodied AI)
- **GAIA**: 466 human-curated multi-step reasoning tasks

**Current performance**:
- WebArena: 14% -> 60% (2023-2025)
- GAIA: 77% human-AI performance gap

**Why they're relevant to ix**: These show task complexity that exceeds current capabilities. If ix measures agents, these benchmarks are the ceiling.

**Source**:
- Agent Harness Landscape report, "Academic Agent Benchmarks" section

---

## Part 5: What Anthropic Specifically Recommends

Anthropic is the most relevant voice for ix (measuring Claude Code extensions). Here's their unified guidance extracted from 40+ sources.

### Core Terminology (Anthropic's Framework)

From ["Demystifying Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents):

- **Task**: Single test with inputs + success criteria
- **Trial**: One attempt at a task (multiple trials handle stochasticity)
- **Grader**: Logic scoring agent performance
- **Transcript/Trace**: Complete record (outputs, tool calls, reasoning)
- **Outcome**: Final environment state (not agent's claim)
- **Harness**: Infrastructure running measurements end-to-end

This is the standard terminology. Use it.

---

### The Zero-to-One Roadmap (8 Steps)

Anthropic's practical guide from ["Demystifying Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents):

**0. Start early**: 20-50 simple tasks from real failures = excellent starting point

**1. Convert manual tests first**: You already have manual checks. Automate them.

**2. Write unambiguous tasks**: Two domain experts should independently reach same pass/fail. If 0% pass@100, the task is broken (not the agent).

**3. Build balanced problem sets**: Test positive and negative cases. Avoid class imbalance.

**4. Build robust harness**: Each trial from clean environment. Prevent shared state, correlated failures.

**5. Design graders thoughtfully**:
- Grade outcome, not path
- Support partial credit
- Calibrate LLM graders with humans
- Grade each dimension separately

**6. Check the transcripts**: Scores without transcript analysis are unreliable

**7. Monitor saturation**: SWE-bench went 30% -> 80% in one year. Saturated benchmarks provide no improvement signal.

**8. Keep suites healthy**: Treat like unit tests. Dedicated teams own infrastructure.

---

### Statistical Methods (From Evan Miller's Research)

From ["Adding Error Bars"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00640):

**Always report**:
- Mean score
- Standard error (SEM)
- 95% confidence interval: \`mean +/- 1.96 x SEM\`

**Use clustered SEs** when questions are non-independent (can be 3x larger than naive):

\`\`\`python
# Group by cluster (e.g., passage_id for reading comp)
cluster_means = df.groupby('cluster_id')['score'].mean()
sem_clustered = cluster_means.std() / np.sqrt(len(cluster_means))
\`\`\`

**Use power analysis** to determine sample sizes:
- Small effects require large N
- Frontier model differences are often 2-5 percentage points
- Need 500+ samples to detect 3pp difference with 80% power

**Use paired differences** when comparing models:

\`\`\`python
differences = scores_model_b - scores_model_a
mean_diff = differences.mean()
se_diff = differences.std() / np.sqrt(len(differences))
\`\`\`

---

### Infrastructure Configuration Matters

From ["Infrastructure Noise"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/infrastructure-noise):

**Key findings**:
- Resource allocation shifts scores by **6 percentage points**
- Differences below **3pp** deserve skepticism without documented configs
- Use dual parameters: guaranteed allocation floor + hard kill threshold

**Recommendations**:
- Specify floor and ceiling, not single pinned value
- Run measurements at multiple times across multiple days
- Treat resource config as first-class experimental variable

---

### Grader Design Principles

From ["Create Strong Empirical Tests"](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/develop-tests):

**Hierarchy** (use highest tier feasible):
1. **Code-based**: Exact match, string match, regex. Fastest, most reliable.
2. **LLM-based**: Rubric scoring, binary classification. Fast, flexible, scalable.
3. **Human**: Expert review. Most accurate but expensive — use for calibration only.

**LLM grader best practices**:
- Use different model to grade than model that generated output
- Encourage reasoning: "Think first, then decide. Discard reasoning."
- Provide "way out": Return "Unknown" when lacking information
- Grade each dimension separately (not monolithic)
- Create clear rubrics with specific criteria
- Calibrate with human experts regularly

---

### Metrics Selection

From ["Demystifying Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents):

| Situation | Metric | Formula | Why |
|-----------|--------|---------|-----|
| One success matters (coding) | **pass@k** | 1 - (1-p)^k | Probability of at least one success |
| Consistency matters (customer-facing) | **pass^k** | p^k | Probability all trials succeed |
| Semantic similarity | **Cosine similarity** | SBERT embeddings | Captures meaning, not surface form |
| Summarization | **ROUGE-L** | LCS F1 | Longest common subsequence |
| Subjective quality | **LLM-based Likert** | 1-5 scale | Captures nuance |
| Binary classification | **LLM-based binary** | Yes/no | Context-aware |

**Critical**: (0.75)^3 = 42% (pass^3) vs 1 - (0.25)^3 = 98% (pass@3). Same agent, wildly different numbers.

---

### Types: Capability vs Regression

From ["Demystifying Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents):

**Capability tests**: "What can this do?"
- Start at low pass rate
- Hills to climb
- Measure progress

**Regression tests**: "Does it still work?"
- Must maintain ~100% pass rate
- Protect against backsliding
- Catch breaking changes

**Graduation**: High-pass capability tests graduate to regression suites.

---

### Behavioral Measurement (Bloom Architecture)

From [Bloom research](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/bloom-auto-evals/):

**Four-stage pipeline**:

1. **Understanding**: Agent reads behavior description, generates understanding of what to measure
2. **Ideation**: Generates scenarios designed to elicit target behavior
3. **Rollout**: Executes scenarios in parallel with simulated users and tools
4. **Judgment**: Judge model scores transcripts; meta-judge produces suite report

**Why it's relevant to ix**: Bloom's pipeline (Understand -> Ideate -> Rollout -> Judge) maps to ix's probe-sensor-grader-scorer ontology. Scenario generation is powerful.

**Source**: [Bloom GitHub](https://github.com/safety-research/bloom)

---

### The Swiss Cheese Model

From ["Demystifying Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents):

**No single method catches everything.** Combine:

- Automated tests (scale)
- Production monitoring (real user patterns)
- A/B testing (causal impact)
- User feedback (qualitative)
- Manual transcript review (deep understanding)
- Systematic human studies (gold standard)

Each layer has holes. Layering catches more.

---

### Frameworks Anthropic Uses Internally

From ["Demystifying Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents):

**Primary**:
- **Promptfoo**: "Anthropic uses a version for product evals"
- **Harbor**: Containerized agent environments (internal tool)

**Recommended**:
- Braintrust (offline + production, CI/CD)
- LangSmith (tracing, datasets, LangChain)
- Langfuse (self-hosted alternative)

---

## Part 6: The Critical Gaps ix Must Fill

Now that you understand the landscape, here's what **doesn't exist**.

### Gap 1: Skill Activation Measurement

**Question**: "Given this context, does the agent activate the right skill/plugin?"

**What exists**: OpenAI's blog post ["Testing Agent Skills Systematically"](https://developers.openai.com/blog/eval-skills/) describes the pattern (use structured JSON output to verify skill invocation). But there's no tooling.

**Why it matters**: You're building a Claude Code skill marketplace. Users need to know "does the security review skill actually trigger when I paste vulnerable code?"

**What ix provides**:
- **PromptProbe**: Generates test inputs designed to trigger specific skills
- **ActivationSensor**: Observes which skills activated
- **MatcherSensor** (puma): Matches actual vs expected activations
- **ClassificationScorer**: F1 score across activation cases

**Example**:

\`\`\`python
# Test case: Should this trigger the security-review skill?
test_case = {
    "input": "Review this code: cursor.execute(f'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}')",
    "expected_skills": ["security-review"],
    "expected_findings": ["SQL injection vulnerability"]
}

# Probe generates input, sensor observes, scorer computes F1
result = ix.run_activation_test(test_cases=[test_case])
# Result: precision=0.92, recall=0.88, F1=0.90
\`\`\`

**Source**: Research Synthesis report, "Five Confirmed Gaps" section

---

### Gap 2: Coexistence / Interference Measurement

**Question**: "Does adding skill B change skill A's behavior?"

**What exists**:
- **CooperBench** (Jan 2026): Multi-agent cooperation benchmark. Found frontier models achieve only 25% success when two agents collaborate — half the single-agent rate.
- **SWE-EVO**: Measures plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (retaining old tasks) with CL-F1 score.

But these measure task-level degradation, not skill-level interference within a single agent.

**Why it matters**: You add a "explain-code" skill to an agent that already has "write-tests". Does the agent now over-explain instead of writing tests? This is invisible to single-skill tests.

**What ix provides**:
- **Comparative experiment**: Control (skill A alone) vs variant (skills A+B together)
- **ActivationSensor**: Measures whether A's activation changes when B is present
- **DeltaScorer**: Computes delta F1, delta accuracy between control and variant

**Example**:

\`\`\`python
# Control: security-review skill alone
control = ix.Experiment(skills=["security-review"])

# Variant: security-review + code-optimization
variant = ix.Experiment(skills=["security-review", "code-optimization"])

# Run same test cases through both
result = ix.run_coexistence_test(control, variant, test_cases)

# Result: security-review F1 dropped from 0.90 to 0.78 when code-optimization added
# Interference detected: code-optimization generates explanations that suppress security warnings
\`\`\`

### Gap 3: Context Degradation Measurement

**Question**: "How does agent behavior degrade after N tool calls / crowded context?"

**What exists**: Nothing. Phil Schmid's January 2026 thesis identified this as the critical gap for 2026:

> "Task durability — how well a model follows instructions after its 50th or 100th tool call — is what matters but isn't measured. A 1% leaderboard difference can't detect reliability drift."

Anthropic's ["Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) describes the problem (longer context often makes things worse) but doesn't provide tooling.

**Why it matters**: Your agent works great for the first 10 interactions. After 50 tool calls, it starts hallucinating. Standard benchmarks run 1-5 tool calls and declare victory.

**What ix provides**:
- **PromptProbe with escalating context load**: Systematically increases tool calls, context size
- **TimingSensor**: Tracks latency as context grows
- **ActivationSensor**: Measures whether correct skills still trigger at step 50
- **DegradationScorer**: Plots accuracy, latency, activation F1 vs context size

**Example**:

\`\`\`python
# Test case: Does the agent maintain accuracy after 100 tool calls?
degradation_test = ix.ContextDegradationTest(
    skill="code-review",
    max_tool_calls=100,
    checkpoints=[10, 25, 50, 75, 100]
)

result = ix.run_degradation_test(degradation_test)

# Result: Accuracy at step 10: 92%, step 50: 78%, step 100: 61%
# Context degradation detected: Agent loses focus after 50 calls
\`\`\`

### Gap 4: DAG-Based Experiment Orchestration

**Question**: "Can probes, sensors, scorers, reporters compose as a dependency graph?"

**What exists**:
- **DeepEval** has DAG metrics (scoring logic as a decision tree within a single metric)
- **Dagster** has DAG orchestration (workflow management for data pipelines)
- **Nobody combines them** for experimentation

**Why it matters**: Your experiment has:
1. Retrieval sensor (measures doc retrieval quality)
2. Generation sensor (measures answer quality)
3. F1 scorer (computes F1 from retrieval precision + recall)
4. Cost sensor (tracks API spend)
5. Composite scorer (aggregates quality + cost as Pareto curve)

This is a dependency graph: Scorers 3 and 5 depend on sensors 1, 2, 4. Running them sequentially wastes time. Running them as a DAG is parallel where possible.

**What ix provides**:
- **Matrix engine**: Kind-agnostic DAG with parallel dispatch via Python's \`graphlib\`
- **Typed components**: Probes, Sensors, Graders, Scorers, Reporters compose as nodes
- **Automatic parallelization**: Independent branches execute concurrently

**Example**:

\`\`\`python
# Define DAG
dag = ix.ExperimentDAG()
dag.add_probe("prompt_probe")
dag.add_sensor("retrieval_sensor", depends_on=["prompt_probe"])
dag.add_sensor("generation_sensor", depends_on=["prompt_probe"])
dag.add_scorer("f1_scorer", depends_on=["retrieval_sensor", "generation_sensor"])
dag.add_reporter("console_reporter", depends_on=["f1_scorer"])

# Execute (automatic parallelization)
result = ix.run(dag)

# retrieval_sensor and generation_sensor run in parallel
# f1_scorer waits for both, then runs
# console_reporter waits for f1_scorer, then prints
\`\`\`

### Gap 5: Collaborative Intelligence Measurement

**Question**: "Does the extension make the human more capable, not dependent?"

**What exists**: Nothing. This requires longitudinal, human-in-the-loop measurement — a fundamentally different paradigm.

**Why it matters**: From the [evidence base](the-evidence.md):

> "AI reliably improves immediate task performance while simultaneously degrading the cognitive foundations that enable long-term human capability."
>
> - 26% more tasks completed with AI (productivity gains are real)
> - 17% worse exam performance without AI (learning harm is real)
> - 20% skill reduction after 3 months (deskilling is measurable)

Standard tests measure "does the AI produce good output?" Collaborative intelligence measurement asks "does the human get better over time?"

**What ix provides**: Not yet. This is M3+ territory. But ix's architecture enables it:

- **Longitudinal trials**: Track human performance with and without agent over weeks
- **Transfer tests**: After using agent for N tasks, measure human capability alone
- **Learning curves**: Plot human skill acquisition vs agent usage intensity

**The hardest gap.**

### What ix Should Borrow

From the research synthesis:

| From | Take | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| **Inspect AI** | TaskState + store, epochs/reducers, async execution | Only framework with shared state and first-class stochastic handling |
| **LM Harness** | Bootstrap stderr, metric aggregation | Mature statistical infrastructure |
| **Promptfoo** | YAML test definitions, Claude Agent SDK provider | Best declarative DX, Anthropic uses it |
| **DeepEval** | DAG metric concept | Shows how to compose LLM calls as decision trees |
| **Anthropic** | Task/trial/transcript/outcome framework, pass@k | Canonical terminology and methodology |
| **Statsig** | CUPED variance reduction, sequential testing | Reduces sample size requirements 2-5x |
| **Bloom** | Understand -> Ideate -> Rollout -> Judge pipeline | Architecture for behavioral measurement generation |

---

### What ix Should NOT Build

From the research synthesis:

- **Observability**: Langfuse, Opik, Phoenix already do this. ix produces results; they visualize.
- **Red-teaming**: Promptfoo owns this (50+ vulnerability types, OWASP/NIST/MITRE).
- **Model benchmarking**: LM Harness owns this (60+ benchmarks, HuggingFace leaderboard).
- **Prompt optimization**: DSPy owns this. ix measures; DSPy optimizes.

**ix is an experimentation platform for cognitive extensions.** Stay in that lane.

## Part 8: Key Research Papers That Change How We Think

These aren't just citations — they fundamentally shift how you design experiments.

### 1. "Adding Error Bars" (Anthropic, Nov 2024)

**Paper**: [arXiv:2411.00640](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00640)
**Blog**: [Statistical Approach to Model Measurements](https://www.anthropic.com/research/statistical-approach-to-model-evals)

**Key contribution**: Clustered standard errors can be **3x larger** than naive calculations. Most frameworks report naive SEM — wildly overconfident.

**Actionable**:
- Always use clustered SEs when questions are non-independent
- Report paired differences with correlation coefficients
- Use power analysis to determine sample sizes

**Before this paper**: "My agent scores 78% +/- 1%."
**After this paper**: "My agent scores 78% +/- 3% (clustered SE), CI [72%, 84%]. Paired difference vs baseline: +5% +/- 2%, CI [1%, 9%], correlation r=0.54."

---

### 2. "Don't Use the CLT" (ICML 2025 Spotlight)

**Paper**: [arXiv:2503.01747](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01747)

**Key contribution**: Central Limit Theorem underestimates uncertainty for N < 100. Bayesian methods correct this.

**Actionable**: Use \`bayes_evals\` library for all confidence intervals in small-N settings (which is most experiments).

**Before this paper**: "I have 50 samples, CLT applies, SEM = sigma / sqrt(50)."
**After this paper**: "I have 50 samples, CLT breaks down, use Bayesian credible intervals instead."

---

### 3. "Signal and Noise" (Allen AI, NeurIPS 2025)

**Paper**: [arXiv:2508.13144](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13144)

**Key contribution**: Signal-to-noise ratio as a meta-metric for benchmark quality. If SNR < 2, the benchmark doesn't reliably measure what you think.

**Actionable**: Before investing effort in a benchmark, compute its SNR:

\`\`\`python
# Signal = variance across models
# Noise = variance within model (across trials)
SNR = var_between_models / var_within_model

if SNR < 2:
    print("Benchmark is too noisy, redesign or get more samples")
\`\`\`

**Before this paper**: "My test suite has high variance. I need more samples."
**After this paper**: "High variance might be high signal (models differ a lot) or high noise (trials differ a lot). SNR tells me which."

---

### 4. "AI Agents That Matter" (Princeton, Jul 2024)

**Paper**: [arXiv:2407.01502](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01502)

**Key contribution**: Always report cost alongside accuracy. Pareto curves reveal the real tradeoffs.

**Example**: LATS costs 50x more than baselines but papers don't report this. When you add cost to the graph, LATS is Pareto-dominated by cheaper methods.

**Actionable**: Every ix scorer must track:
- Quality metrics (accuracy, F1, ROUGE, etc.)
- Cost (API spend, latency, token count)
- Pareto frontier (max quality per dollar)

**Before this paper**: "Agent A: 85% accuracy. Agent B: 82% accuracy. A wins."
**After this paper**: "Agent A: 85% @ $2.50/task. Agent B: 82% @ $0.03/task. B wins for production, A wins for research."

---

### 5. CooperBench (Jan 2026)

**Paper**: [arXiv:2601.13295](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13295)

**Key contribution**: First benchmark measuring multi-agent cooperation. Frontier models achieve only **25% success** when two agents collaborate — roughly half single-agent rate.

**Three failure modes**:
1. Agents fail to communicate actionable information
2. Agents deviate from commitments
3. Agents hold incorrect expectations about partners

**Actionable for ix**: Coexistence tests must check for these failure modes. When skill B is added:
- Does skill A receive actionable information from B?
- Does A's behavior change when B is present?
- Do A and B have correct expectations about each other's activation?

---

### 6. SWE-EVO (Jan 2026)

**Paper**: [arXiv:2512.18470](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18470)

**Key contribution**: Introduces **CL-F1** (continual learning F1):
- **CL-Plasticity**: Ability to learn new tasks
- **CL-Stability**: Retention of performance on previous tasks
- **CL-F1**: Harmonic mean of plasticity and stability

**Actionable for ix**: Coexistence testing is a special case of continual learning:
- Plasticity = "can the agent use skill B?"
- Stability = "does skill A still work after adding B?"
- CL-F1 = overall coexistence score

**Example**:
\`\`\`python
# Before: security-review skill scores F1=0.90
# After adding code-optimization skill:
plasticity = 0.92  # code-optimization works well
stability = 0.78   # security-review degraded
cl_f1 = 2 * (plasticity * stability) / (plasticity + stability)  # = 0.84

# Interpretation: Code-optimization added successfully, but interfered with security-review
\`\`\`

---

## Part 9: Putting It All Together — A Worked Example

Let's walk through a realistic ix experiment from start to finish.

### Scenario

You've built a Claude Code skill called \`security-review\`. It analyzes code for vulnerabilities. You want to:

1. Measure skill activation accuracy ("does it trigger when it should?")
2. Detect coexistence interference ("does adding \`code-style\` break it?")
3. Track context degradation ("does it work after 50 file reviews?")
4. Ensure statistical rigor (Bayesian CIs, not naive CLT)

---

### Step 1: Define Tasks (Anthropic's Framework)

**Task**: Test case with inputs + success criteria

\`\`\`python
tasks = [
    {
        "id": "sql_injection_1",
        "input": "cursor.execute(f'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}')",
        "expected_skill": "security-review",
        "expected_finding": "SQL injection vulnerability",
        "cluster": "sql_injection"  # For clustered SEs
    },
    {
        "id": "sql_injection_2",
        "input": "query = 'DELETE FROM logs WHERE ' + user_input; execute(query)",
        "expected_skill": "security-review",
        "expected_finding": "SQL injection via concatenation",
        "cluster": "sql_injection"
    },
    # ... 48 more tasks across 5 clusters
]
\`\`\`

**Note**: 50 tasks, 5 clusters (10 tasks per cluster) for clustered SE calculation.

---

### Step 2: Define Experiment DAG

\`\`\`python
experiment = ix.Experiment(
    name="security-review-activation",
    trials_per_task=10,  # pass@10 and pass^10 metrics
)

# DAG nodes
experiment.add_probe("prompt_probe")  # Generates test inputs
experiment.add_sensor("activation_sensor", depends_on=["prompt_probe"])  # Observes skill activation
experiment.add_sensor("finding_sensor", depends_on=["prompt_probe"])  # Extracts security findings
experiment.add_grader("activation_grader", depends_on=["activation_sensor"])  # Matches expected vs actual
experiment.add_grader("finding_grader", depends_on=["finding_sensor"])  # Matches expected finding
experiment.add_scorer("classification_scorer", depends_on=["activation_grader", "finding_grader"])  # F1
experiment.add_scorer("stochastic_scorer", depends_on=["classification_scorer"])  # pass@k, pass^k
experiment.add_scorer("cost_scorer", depends_on=["activation_sensor"])  # Tracks API spend
experiment.add_reporter("console_reporter", depends_on=["stochastic_scorer", "cost_scorer"])
\`\`\`

**DAG parallelization**:
- \`activation_sensor\` and \`finding_sensor\` run in parallel (both depend only on probe)
- \`activation_grader\` and \`finding_grader\` run in parallel
- \`classification_scorer\` waits for both graders
- \`stochastic_scorer\` computes pass@k from classification results
- \`cost_scorer\` runs independently
- \`console_reporter\` waits for both scorers

---

### Step 3: Run Experiment (Skill Activation)

\`\`\`python
result = ix.run(experiment, tasks=tasks)

# Result structure:
{
    "mean_f1": 0.88,
    "se_clustered": 0.03,  # 3x larger than naive SE=0.01
    "ci_95": [0.82, 0.94],
    "pass_at_10": 0.98,  # At least one success in 10 trials
    "pass_pow_10": 0.28,  # All 10 trials succeed
    "total_cost": 4.23,  # USD
    "cost_per_task": 0.085,
    "transcripts": [...]  # Full traces for inspection
}
\`\`\`

**Interpretation**:
- F1 = 0.88 means precision/recall are high (skill activates correctly)
- Clustered SE = 0.03 (not 0.01) because SQL injection tasks correlate
- pass@10 = 98% means "at least once in 10 tries" almost always works
- pass^10 = 28% means "all 10 tries" rarely works — stochastic variance is high
- Cost = $0.085/task is reasonable for security review

---

### Step 4: Coexistence Test (Does Adding \`code-style\` Break It?)

\`\`\`python
# Control: security-review alone
control = ix.Experiment(
    name="control",
    skills=["security-review"]
)

# Variant: security-review + code-style
variant = ix.Experiment(
    name="variant",
    skills=["security-review", "code-style"]
)

# Run both on same tasks
coexistence_result = ix.run_paired([control, variant], tasks=tasks)

# Result:
{
    "control_f1": 0.88,
    "variant_f1": 0.76,  # Dropped!
    "delta_f1": -0.12,
    "se_paired": 0.02,  # Paired SE (smaller than independent)
    "ci_95": [-0.16, -0.08],
    "correlation": 0.61,  # Tasks correlate across experiments
    "interpretation": "Code-style skill interferes with security-review. F1 dropped 12 points (p < 0.001)."
}
\`\`\`

**Interpretation**:
- F1 dropped from 0.88 to 0.76 when code-style added
- Paired CI = [-0.16, -0.08] doesn't include zero -> **significant degradation**
- Transcript analysis shows: code-style generates explanations that suppress security warnings
- **Coexistence interference detected**

---

### Step 5: Context Degradation Test

\`\`\`python
degradation_experiment = ix.ContextDegradationExperiment(
    skill="security-review",
    max_tool_calls=100,
    checkpoints=[10, 25, 50, 75, 100]
)

degradation_result = ix.run(degradation_experiment, tasks=tasks)

# Result:
{
    "checkpoints": {
        10:  {"f1": 0.88, "latency_p50": 1.2, "cost": 0.09},
        25:  {"f1": 0.85, "latency_p50": 1.4, "cost": 0.11},
        50:  {"f1": 0.78, "latency_p50": 1.9, "cost": 0.14},
        75:  {"f1": 0.71, "latency_p50": 2.5, "cost": 0.19},
        100: {"f1": 0.63, "latency_p50": 3.2, "cost": 0.26},
    },
    "degradation_rate": -0.0025,  # F1 drops 0.25 points per 10 tool calls
    "interpretation": "Context degradation detected. Agent loses focus after 50 calls."
}
\`\`\`

**Interpretation**:
- F1 at step 10: 88% (baseline)
- F1 at step 50: 78% (10-point drop)
- F1 at step 100: 63% (25-point drop)
- Latency and cost also increase (crowded context is expensive)
- **Context degradation confirmed**

---

### Step 6: Statistical Rigor (Bayesian CIs)

\`\`\`python
# ix automatically uses bayes_evals for small-N
from bayes_evals import bayesian_ci

# Instead of CLT (wrong):
sem_clt = np.std(f1_scores) / np.sqrt(len(f1_scores))
ci_clt = [mean - 1.96*sem_clt, mean + 1.96*sem_clt]  # Underestimates uncertainty

# Bayesian (correct):
ci_bayes = bayesian_ci(f1_scores, confidence=0.95)  # Wider, more honest

# Result:
# CLT CI: [0.85, 0.91] (overconfident)
# Bayes CI: [0.82, 0.94] (realistic)
\`\`\`

**Why this matters**: With 50 tasks, CLT breaks down. Bayesian methods give you honest uncertainty.

---

### Step 7: Pareto Analysis (Cost vs Quality)

\`\`\`python
# Collect quality and cost across variants
variants = [
    {"name": "security-review-base", "f1": 0.88, "cost": 0.085},
    {"name": "security-review-cot", "f1": 0.91, "cost": 0.14},
    {"name": "security-review-lightweight", "f1": 0.82, "cost": 0.03},
]

pareto_result = ix.compute_pareto(variants, quality_metric="f1", cost_metric="cost")

# Result: Pareto frontier
# - Lightweight: 0.82 F1 @ $0.03 (best for cost-sensitive)
# - Base: 0.88 F1 @ $0.085 (balanced)
# - CoT: 0.91 F1 @ $0.14 (best for quality-sensitive)

# CoT is NOT Pareto-optimal -- it costs 1.65x more for only 3-point improvement
# For production: use base or lightweight depending on budget
\`\`\`

**Interpretation**: Always show cost-quality tradeoffs. Pure accuracy rankings hide the real decision.

**Source**: [AI Agents That Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01502)

---

### Step 8: Quality Gate (CI/CD Integration)

\`\`\`python
# Define thresholds
quality_gate = ix.QualityGate(
    min_f1=0.80,
    max_degradation=0.05,  # Alert if F1 drops >5pp vs baseline
    max_cost_per_task=0.10,
)

# Check results
gate_result = quality_gate.check(result)

if gate_result.passed:
    print("Quality gate passed. Deploy to production.")
else:
    print(f"Quality gate failed: {gate_result.failures}")
    sys.exit(1)
\`\`\`

**Integration**: Run this in GitHub Actions on every PR. Block merge if quality regresses.

## Part 10: Final Mental Model — What You've Learned

You started knowing Python and Claude Code skills. Now you know:

### 1. Measurement Under Uncertainty

It's not pass/fail. It's distributions, confidence intervals, and tradeoffs.

### 2. State, Execution, Stochasticity, Grading

Every framework makes choices on these four dimensions. Most make bad choices (no state, sequential execution, no stochastic handling, brittle grading).

### 3. Statistics Matter More Than You Think

- Clustered SEs can be 3x larger than naive
- CLT breaks down for small N (use Bayesian)
- Infrastructure noise is 3-6 percentage points
- Paired differences are more powerful than independent comparisons

### 4. Anthropic's Guidance Is Canonical

- Task/trial/transcript/outcome terminology
- pass@k vs pass^k metrics
- Grade outcome, not path
- 20-50 tasks from real failures = starting point
- Code > LLM > Human grading hierarchy

### 5. The Gaps ix Fills Are Real

- Skill activation: No tool tests "right skill for right context"
- Coexistence: No tool tests "adding B breaks A"
- Context degradation: No benchmark measures "works after 50 calls"
- DAG orchestration: No framework composes components as dependency graph

### 6. ix Is Unique

Upper-right quadrant: agent experimentation + statistical rigor + DAG orchestration.

Nobody else is there.

`,qc=`# First Principles of Collaborative Intelligence

These principles emerged from asking: what does it take to work with AI without becoming dependent on it? They're not philosophical ideals—they're practical guardrails drawn from research on how AI collaboration succeeds and fails. Each principle connects a timeless insight to evidence from studies on human-AI interaction.

---

## 1. Don't Fool Yourself

> "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool."
> — Richard Feynman

When you see AI output that looks right, your brain wants to move on. The work appears done. This is where the trap closes.

Research shows developers spend only 22.4% of their coding time verifying AI suggestions <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Mozannar et al. CHI 2024, n=21 programmers, behavioral coding study">◐</span>. The rest is accepting, integrating, moving forward. Meanwhile, 40-50% of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Perry et al. 2023, Pearce et al. 2022 — controlled generation studies">●</span>. The mismatch isn't the AI's fault—it's verification effort dropping below the error rate.

You know you should check the output. You don't, because it *looks* convincing. That's self-deception in action. The countermeasure: make verification a separate step from generation. Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) does this by answering fact-check questions independently, without access to the original response. Result: 50-70% reduction in hallucination <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Dhuliawala et al. ACL 2024, averaged across 4 benchmarks">●</span>. Same model, different process, opposite outcome.

**What it looks like:** Before accepting AI-generated code, close the AI output. Write down what you expect the code to do. Open it back up. Does it match? If you can't articulate the expectation independently, you haven't verified—you've just agreed.

---

## 2. Humility About Your Skull

> "The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull."
> — Edsger Dijkstra

Your working memory holds about 4-7 chunks of information <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Sweller et al. 2011, Cognitive Load Theory synthesis">●</span>. Complex systems exceed this by orders of magnitude. AI doesn't change the size of your skull—it changes what you can keep outside it.

This is why transparency (β = 0.415) matters almost as much as control (β = 0.507) for collaboration success <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Blaurock et al. 2025, scenario experiments, n=654">◐</span>. When AI shows its reasoning, you offload verification to external structure instead of holding the entire decision tree in working memory. When it doesn't, you're left trusting or rejecting based on vibes—both failures of collaboration.

The mistake is thinking AI removes cognitive load. It shifts it. From execution to evaluation. From remembering syntax to assessing correctness. The load doesn't disappear; it changes shape. If you can't see the AI's reasoning, the evaluation load exceeds your skull's capacity, and you fall back to blind acceptance.

**What it looks like:** An AI tool that shows you "Here's what I found, here's why I think it matters, here's what I'm uncertain about" gives you *structure* to evaluate against. An AI that just hands you an answer asks you to hold the entire correctness check in your head. One respects the size of your skull. The other pretends it doesn't exist.

---

## 3. The Whole is Other Than the Sum

> "The whole is other than the sum of its parts."
> — Kurt Koffka (Gestalt psychology)

This is the central insight of collaborative intelligence. Human + AI isn't human-with-a-tool. It's a different kind of cognitive system with properties neither has alone.

The evidence base shows this clearly: mastery-oriented users (focused on learning) maintain problem-solving capability even with AI assistance (OR = 35.7) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Lee et al. CHI 2025, n=170 students, longitudinal">●</span>. Performance-oriented users (focused on output) degrade significantly (Z = -6.295) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Same study, inverse correlation">●</span>. Same AI tool. Different approach to the collaboration. Completely different outcomes.

The system isn't "you" + "AI". It's how you *relate* to each other. Do you treat AI as a shortcut or a thinking partner? Do you explain your reasoning to it, or just ask for answers? These interaction patterns create emergent properties—either compounding capability or compounding dependence.

**What it looks like:** A senior developer uses AI to explore alternative implementations, then picks one and refines it manually. A junior developer asks AI for the solution and moves on. The senior's capability compounds—they see patterns across options, learn tradeoffs, build intuition. The junior's atrophies—they never practiced the decision. Same AI. Different collaboration pattern. Different outcome.

---

## 4. Only Variety Absorbs Variety

> "Only variety can absorb variety."
> — W. Ross Ashby (Law of Requisite Variety)

A system can only handle complexity matching its own internal complexity. If the environment has 100 possible states and your system has 10 responses, you're undermatched by an order of magnitude.

This principle appears in the expertise reversal effect: high guidance helps novices (d = 0.505) but harms experts (d = -0.428) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Kalyuga et al. 2003, Educational Psychology Review meta-analysis">●</span>. Novices have low internal variety—they need scaffolding. Experts have high internal variety—scaffolding becomes noise. Same intervention, opposite effects, because requisite variety differs.

For AI collaboration, this means: if you hand complex decisions to AI, you need internal complexity to evaluate them. The evidence is stark. Senior developers trust AI suggestions least (2.5% acceptance) but use AI most effectively. Junior developers trust more (17% acceptance) but verify less <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Vaithilingam et al. 2024, GitHub Copilot study, n=20">●</span>. The juniors lack requisite variety to absorb the complexity AI introduces.

**What it looks like:** Before using AI for a complex task, ask: do I have enough understanding to evaluate the output? If not, either build that understanding first, or constrain the AI to simpler contributions you *can* evaluate. Variety must match. Otherwise you're accepting complexity you can't absorb.

---

## 5. Understand Before Changing

> "If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away."
> — G.K. Chesterton (Chesterton's Fence)

Don't remove something until you understand why it's there. In software: don't refactor code you don't understand. In AI collaboration: don't accept changes to systems you haven't internalized.

The WHY &gt; HOW principle demonstrates this: when developers understand *why* a security practice matters, 80% write secure code. When they only know *how* (prescriptive rules), only 30% do <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Acar et al. IEEE S&P 2017, n=307 developers, controlled study">●</span>. The difference is understanding the fence—the reasoning behind the practice.

AI excels at generating "how" but often skips "why". It can refactor code, suggest patterns, propose architectures—all without explaining the constraints that led to the current design. If you don't understand those constraints, you can't evaluate whether the AI's changes preserve or violate them.

**What it looks like:** You see legacy code with an odd pattern. AI suggests "cleaning it up". Before accepting: investigate why the pattern exists. Maybe it's a workaround for a subtle race condition. Maybe it's cargo-culted nonsense. The AI doesn't know. If you don't either, accepting the change is tearing down a fence you don't understand.

---

## 6. Antifragility Over Robustness

> "Antifragility is beyond resilience. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better."
> — Nassim Taleb

Robust systems resist failure. Antifragile systems improve from stress. In AI collaboration: do your skills degrade from AI use (fragile), stay constant (robust), or strengthen (antifragile)?

The evidence shows all three are possible. GPT Tutor (hints only, forces reasoning) caused no learning harm. GPT Base (direct answers) caused 17% worse exam performance <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Bastani et al. PNAS 2025, n=1,000 students, RCT">●</span>. Same underlying AI. Different interaction design. One fragile, one antifragile.

The pattern: AI that makes you think becomes a whetstone—your capability sharpens through use. AI that thinks for you becomes a crutch—your capability atrophies. After AI-assisted colonoscopy was introduced, endoscopists' unaided detection rate declined 20% on their non-AI cases <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Budzyń et al. Lancet 2025, multicentre observational, 19 endoscopists">◐</span>. The automation made them fragile.

**What it looks like:** After using AI for a task, ask: am I better at this than before? If you used AI to explore testing strategies and now understand test design more deeply—antifragile. If you used AI to write tests and still have no idea why those assertions matter—fragile. The AI interaction should leave you more capable, not just with more output.

---

## 7. Fuzzy Over False Precision

> "As complexity rises, precise statements lose meaning and meaningful statements lose precision."
> — Lotfi Zadeh (Fuzzy Logic)

LLMs produce confident outputs for uncertain problems. They format responses with precision (markdown tables, numbered lists, confident language) while the underlying reasoning may be speculative. This is false precision—the appearance of certainty without its substance.

The mitigation: explicit uncertainty. Research shows that expressing confidence levels prevents overreliance <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Blaurock et al. 2025, transparency β=0.415, n=654">◐</span>. Not by making AI less useful, but by calibrating trust appropriately. When AI says "this is speculative, no direct evidence exists", you know to verify. When it projects false certainty, you don't.

Neural evidence: EEG studies show AI use causes "systematically scaled down" connectivity in brain regions responsible for critical thinking <span class="ev ev-weak" title="Kosmyna et al. 2025, arXiv preprint, n=54">○</span>. One mechanism: AI's confident tone suppresses the uncertainty signals that normally trigger deeper evaluation.

**What it looks like:** Compare two AI responses. First: "Use Redis for caching." Second: "Redis is common for caching (strong evidence from production use), though evaluation depends on access patterns (speculative without profiling your workload)." The second respects Zadeh's principle. It sacrifices false precision for meaningful guidance. The first hides uncertainty behind confident prescription.

---

## Synthesis

These principles converge on a single idea: **collaboration requires seeing clearly**. Don't fool yourself about whether you've verified. Respect the limits of your cognition. Recognize that human+AI creates emergent properties. Match your internal complexity to the problems you're solving. Understand systems before changing them. Design interactions that strengthen rather than weaken. Embrace uncertainty over false confidence.

The research base shows: control (β = 0.507) and transparency (β = 0.415) are the strongest levers for collaboration success <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Blaurock et al. 2025, scenario experiments, n=654">◐</span>. These principles operationalize that finding. They're not about using AI less—they're about using it in ways that compound your capability rather than erode it.

Every AI interaction is a choice: fragile or antifragile, dependency or amplification, performance or mastery. The principles won't make that choice for you. They'll help you see it clearly.

`,Wc=`# Hype & Questioning

Why we believe AI makes us faster when it doesn't — and how to read research (including this library's) without fooling yourself.

---

## The Gap You Can't See

You're reading a vendor blog post: "Developers using our AI tool complete 40% more tasks." Sounds good. You try it. Code appears on screen faster than you've ever written it. You feel productive. You ship features. Everyone's happy.

Three months later, your team is finding more bugs in production. Code reviews take twice as long. You can't explain how parts of your own codebase work without prompting the AI again. But you're still using the tool because it *feels* fast.

This is the perception gap. And it's not a bug — it's how these tools work on human cognition.

**The mechanism:** Time spent prompting, reviewing suggestions, fixing integration errors, and context-switching doesn't register as "work." Code appearing on screen feels like productivity. The invisible effort disappears from your awareness. You perceive speed. Measurements show slowdown. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="METR study, n=16 developers, rigorous within-subject design but small sample">◐</span>

One study measured this precisely: experienced developers predicted they'd be 24% faster with AI. They were actually 19% slower. That's a 43-point miscalibration. Not user error. Structural misperception. [See productivity evidence →](../reference/productivity-evidence)

The gap prevents self-correction. If you believe you're faster, you won't measure. If you don't measure, you won't discover the truth. The illusion sustains itself.

## Why Critical Thinking Erodes

Here's the pattern researchers found: the more confident you are in AI, the less you verify its output. Higher AI confidence predicts less critical thinking (β = -0.69). <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Lee et al. CHI 2025, n=319, structural equation modeling">●</span> Not "some people verify less." Systematic correlation. Trust goes up, questioning goes down. [See cognitive effects evidence →](../reference/cognitive-effects-evidence)

This has a name: **automation bias**. The tendency to favor machine-generated output over contradictory information from other sources. You've experienced it with GPS navigation—taking the suggested route even when you know a better one exists. AI coding tools trigger this at industrial scale.

Another study tested it directly: when AI provides explanations along with answers, people rely on those answers more—*regardless of whether the AI is correct*. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Bansal et al. CHI 2021, controlled experiment with correct and incorrect AI">●</span> When AI is right, explanations help slightly. When AI is wrong, performance degrades. Explanations feel like transparency. They function as persuasion.

**The confidence-competence inversion:** Making AI better at appearing confident makes humans worse at being competent.

You can't assess correctness in domains where you lack expertise. AI provides answers to questions you don't fully understand. Each answer feels like learning. In reality, you're offloading comprehension. Students who used unrestricted AI assistance scored 17% worse on exams testing the same material. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Bastani et al. PNAS 2025, n=1,000, randomized controlled trial">●</span> Same knowledge domain. Different pathway to get there. Opposite outcomes. [See skill formation evidence →](../reference/skill-formation-evidence)

## Reading AI Research Without Getting Fooled

Let's apply this to claims you'll encounter—including the ones this library makes.

### 1. Check the Sample Size

n=16 tells you something different than n=4,867. Small samples (n=16, n=52) can be rigorous—but they're exploratory, not definitive. Large samples (n=1,000+) provide stronger evidence of effects. When you see a claim, ask: how many people were actually studied?

The perception gap study? n=16 developers. Rigorous design, meaningful finding, but limited generalizability. The productivity gains study? n=4,867 across multiple trials. Much stronger generalization. Both are cited in this library. They don't have equal weight.

### 2. Check the Study Design

Hierarchy of evidence:
- **Randomized controlled trial (RCT)** — assigns participants randomly, controls for confounds
- **Controlled experiment** — manipulates variables but less random assignment
- **Observational study** — watches what happens naturally, can't prove causation
- **Survey** — self-report, subject to perception bias
- **Anecdote** — individual experience, not generalizable

When a vendor says "our tool improves productivity," ask: compared to what? How was that measured? Who did the measuring?

### 3. Check Domain Transfer

A multicentre observational study found endoscopists' unaided detection rate declined 20% after regular AI-assisted colonoscopy was introduced. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Budzyń et al. Lancet 2025, multicentre observational, 19 endoscopists">◐</span> Does that apply to developers using AI coding assistants? Maybe. Plausible mechanism (skill atrophy from automation). Uncertain magnitude (different domains, different task structures). [See skill formation evidence →](../reference/skill-formation-evidence)

This library treats it as moderate evidence, not strong. The mechanism is credible. The transfer is uncertain. That matters.

### 4. Check the Timeframe

A 70-minute session tells you something. It doesn't tell you what happens after six months of daily use. Short-term studies inform. They don't determine long-term effects.

Most AI-and-learning research measures effects over minutes to weeks. The critical question—developer capability after 6-12 months of daily AI use—has no direct measurement. We're inferring from short-term learning studies and cross-domain analogies. Reasonable inference. Still inference.

### 5. Check Who Funded It

Vendor-funded research showing harm deserves credit. When Anthropic funded a study that showed their own product can harm learning when used without scaffolding, that's intellectual honesty. When OpenAI publishes research showing only benefits, scrutinize harder. Not because they're lying—because incentives shape what gets studied and what gets published.

Publication bias favors positive results. We don't know what studies were run and not published.

### 6. Check What's NOT Measured

The critical study that doesn't exist: longitudinal measurement of developer capability after extended AI use. Everything is either short-term (minutes to weeks) or cross-domain (medicine → software). We're making decisions based on:
- Small samples (n=16, n=52)
- Short timeframes (70 minutes, single sessions)
- Adjacent domains (colonoscopy as proxy for coding)
- Survey self-reports (perception, not performance)

These studies are rigorous within their constraints. The constraints are severe.

## The Vendor Incentive Problem

AI companies optimize for adoption. Adoption correlates with perceived productivity, not measured capability development. This creates a structural problem: the features that feel best may harm most.

Stack Overflow's survey revealed the tension: trust in AI accuracy fell from 43% to 33% in one year. Adoption rose from 76% to 84%. People use tools they don't trust. [See productivity evidence →](../reference/productivity-evidence)

Why? Because perceived productivity overrides measured performance. The perception gap makes bad tools feel good. Market incentives optimize for feel, not outcome.

## Applying This to cix Itself

Let's interrogate the claims this library makes.

**Claims with strong evidence:**
- AI tools improve immediate task performance (multiple large RCTs)
- AI tools can degrade learning when unrestricted (RCT, n=1,000)
- Critical thinking correlates negatively with AI confidence (n=319, structural modeling)
- Automation bias affects AI-assisted decisions (controlled experiments)

**Claims with moderate evidence:**
- The perception gap exists at scale (small rigorous study + survey data)
- Design patterns can preserve learning (small samples, promising but needs replication)
- Control and transparency predict appropriate trust (survey-based, large effects but self-report)

**Claims that are speculative:**
- Long-term capability effects on developers (no direct measurement, inferred from short-term and cross-domain)
- Magnitude of design interventions at scale (preliminary evidence only)
- Whether short-term effects compound or plateau over years

The methodology is to ground claims in sources while being explicit about inference gaps. When this library cites medical skill atrophy as evidence for developer capability risk, it's making a cross-domain inference. Plausible. Not proven. The evidence markers reflect that: moderate, not strong.

## Can Design Change Outcomes?

The research suggests yes—with caveats.

Same study, same technology, different design: when AI gave direct answers, students scored 17% worse on exams. When AI gave hints (not answers), no learning harm. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Bastani et al. PNAS 2025, within-study comparison">●</span> Another pattern: attempt-first-then-AI achieved 86% mastery. Direct-to-AI did not. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Shen & Tamkin 2025, n=52, 70 minutes, promising but small">◐</span> [See collaboration design evidence →](../reference/collaboration-design-evidence)

User control was the strongest predictor of appropriate trust (β = 0.507), followed by transparency (β = 0.415). <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Gerlich et al. 2025, survey-based but large effect sizes">◐</span> Not just nice-to-have features. Measurable effect sizes on calibration.

Same technology. Different interaction patterns. Opposite outcomes.

**The design principles that emerge:**
- Complementary over substitutive (amplify, don't replace)
- Transparency over opacity (show reasoning, not just results)
- Control over automation (human-initiated, not autonomous)
- Mastery-oriented over performance-oriented (optimize for learning, not output)
- Independent verification (generation and review must be separate)

These principles have evidence. Small studies, short timeframe, needs replication at scale. But they're testable hypotheses, not speculation. [See collaboration design evidence →](../reference/collaboration-design-evidence)

## The Questioning Imperative

Richard Feynman: "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool."

The research shows AI tools create tradeoffs: immediate productivity gains, potential long-term capability costs. Both can be true. The question is whether design choices change the trajectory.

The evidence says design matters. The evidence is preliminary. We're acting on best available knowledge while acknowledging its limits.

**What this means for using AI tools:**

1. **Measure, don't assume.** Perception diverges from reality. Track outcomes, not feelings.

2. **Question your own confidence.** Higher trust in AI predicts less verification. When you feel certain, verify harder.

3. **Check who benefits from the claim.** Vendors optimize for adoption. Adoption optimizes for perceived productivity. Neither optimizes for your capability.

4. **Preserve friction where it matters.** The effort that feels wasteful might be the effort that causes learning.

5. **Verify independently.** If AI generated it, review it without AI assistance. Explanations persuade. Verification requires separation.

6. **Ask what's not measured.** Short-term gains don't guarantee long-term capability. The critical study often doesn't exist yet.

## The Honest Position

This library exists because the evidence suggests AI tools, as commonly used, degrade the cognitive foundations that enable long-term capability. The evidence also suggests design changes outcomes. Small studies, promising patterns, needs replication.

That's the state of knowledge: grounded, preliminary, worth acting on. Not settled. Not speculative. Evidence with acknowledged limits.

The alternative—uncritical adoption based on perceived productivity—has evidence showing it fails. Larger studies. Consistent pattern. Worth avoiding.

**The goal:** Design AI tools that make humans more capable, not dependent. Preserve gains, avoid costs. Optimize for compounding mastery, not immediate output.

The research suggests this is possible. The research is preliminary. The methodology is to build extensions grounded in best available evidence while making uncertainty explicit.

Question everything—including this library. If you can't trace a claim to its source and evaluate that source yourself, you're trusting, not verifying. The evidence markers in this text are not decorative. They're invitations to check. [All evidence documented in reference section →](../reference/productivity-evidence)

The first step toward calibrated trust is recognizing when you've stopped questioning.

## The Two Layers

**Matrix** is the platform — the agentic data plane. It owns agent execution, DAG orchestration, storage, configuration, and dependency injection.

**ix** is an experimentation tool — a multi-agent system that runs inside Matrix. It defines experiment models, components, and lifecycle. Matrix handles the rest.

## Matrix: The Platform

### AgentRuntimePort

The universal interface for running agents on any LLM backend:

\`\`\`python
@runtime_checkable
class AgentRuntimePort(Protocol):
    async def invoke(self, system: str, messages: list[dict]) -> str: ...
\`\`\`

Every component that needs an LLM gets this injected. The adapter handles the backend:

| Adapter | Backend | Maps to |
|---------|---------|---------|
| \`ClaudeAdapter\` | Claude SDK | \`query(prompt, ClaudeAgentOptions)\` |
| \`GoogleADKAdapter\` | Google ADK | \`Runner(LlmAgent).run_async()\` |
| \`OllamaAdapter\` | Local models | HTTP API |

Swap backends in config. Nobody else knows.

### The Agent Definition Problem

Claude SDK and Google ADK both define agents, but with different shapes:

| Concept | Claude SDK | Google ADK |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| System prompt | \`system_prompt\` | \`instruction\` |
| Model | \`model: str\` | \`model: str\` |
| Tools | \`allowed_tools: list[str]\` | \`tools: list[ToolUnion]\` |
| Sub-agents | \`agents: dict\` | \`sub_agents: list\` |
| Max turns | \`max_turns: int\` | \`RunConfig.max_llm_calls\` |
| Output format | \`output_format\` (JSON Schema) | \`output_schema\` (Pydantic) |
| Skills | \`setting_sources + Skill tool\` | N/A |
| Plugins | \`plugins: [{type, path}]\` | N/A |
| MCP servers | \`mcp_servers: dict\` | N/A |
| Working dir | \`cwd: str\` | N/A |
| Permissions | \`permission_mode\` | N/A |

The 8 common fields: **name, description, instruction, model, tools, sub_agents, max_turns, output_schema**.

Claude-specific but important: **skills, plugins, MCP servers**. These inject domain knowledge into the agent — critical for ix, where the Subject agent needs specific skills loaded to test activation.

### The Common Abstraction

\`\`\`python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AgentSpec:
    """Runtime-agnostic agent definition."""
    name: str
    instruction: str = ''
    model: str = ''
    tools: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    skills: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    plugins: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    mcp_servers: dict = field(default_factory=dict)
    cwd: str | None = None
    max_turns: int | None = None
    output_schema: dict | None = None
    runtime_config: dict = field(default_factory=dict)
\`\`\`

Each adapter maps \`AgentSpec\` to its native API. The Claude adapter maps \`instruction\` to \`system_prompt\`, \`skills\` to \`setting_sources\` + \`Skill\` in \`allowed_tools\`. The Google ADK adapter maps \`instruction\` to \`instruction\`, ignores \`skills\` (or bakes them into the instruction).

### Construct and Artifacts

Matrix's data plane is the **Construct** — an append-only ledger of immutable **Artifacts**:

\`\`\`python
class Artifact(BaseModel, frozen=True):
    kind: str           # "subject.response", "grader.evaluation", "scorer.row_scores"
    producer: str       # component name
    data: Any           # the actual payload
    id: str             # unique ID
    timestamp: datetime

class Construct(BaseModel, frozen=True):
    subject: str
    artifacts: tuple[Artifact, ...] = ()

    def append(self, artifact: Artifact) -> Construct:
        """Returns NEW instance with artifact added."""
        return self.model_copy(update={"artifacts": self.artifacts + (artifact,)})

    def last(self, kind: str) -> Any:
        """Get data from most recent artifact of given kind."""
        for a in reversed(self.artifacts):
            if a.kind == kind:
                return a.data
        raise KeyError(f"No artifact of kind '{kind}'")
\`\`\`

Components produce data. Matrix wraps it in Artifacts. The Construct carries everything.

### Container and DI

Matrix's Container wires adapters into components:

\`\`\`python
class Container:
    def __init__(self, config: MatrixConfig):
        self.runtime = ClaudeAdapter(...)  # or GoogleADKAdapter, etc.
        self.storage = DuckDBStorage(...)

    def build_component(self, name: str) -> Component:
        cls = ComponentRegistry.get(name)
        return cls(runtime=self.runtime)  # inject runtime
\`\`\`

Any component that needs an LLM gets the runtime injected. The component doesn't know which backend is behind it.

## ix: The Experimentation MAS

### Domain Models

ix uses Pydantic v2 discriminated unions for type-safe experiment configuration:

\`\`\`python
class AgentSubject(BaseModel, frozen=True):
    kind: Literal["agent"] = "agent"
    name: str
    agent_ref: str
    model: str = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
    system_prompt: str | None = None
    tools: list[str] = []
    skills: list[str] = []        # skills to load
    plugins: list[str] = []       # plugins to load

class ServiceSubject(BaseModel, frozen=True):
    kind: Literal["service"] = "service"
    name: str
    image: str
    env: dict[str, str] = {}

Subject = Annotated[Union[AgentSubject, ServiceSubject], Field(discriminator="kind")]
\`\`\`

Similarly for scenarios:

\`\`\`python
class CognitiveScenario(BaseModel, frozen=True):
    kind: Literal["cognitive_task"] = "cognitive_task"
    task_prompt: str
    expected: dict | None = None

class LoadScenario(BaseModel, frozen=True):
    kind: Literal["load_profile"] = "load_profile"
    tool: str = "wrk"
    duration: str = "5m"

Scenario = Annotated[Union[CognitiveScenario, LoadScenario], Field(discriminator="kind")]
\`\`\`

### The Probe Is Data

A probe is a prompt. A string. The stimulus fed to the subject.

\`\`\`yaml
# cases/must-001.md
---
id: must-001
expectation: must_trigger
---
How do I write evals for my Claude skill?
\`\`\`

The probe does NOT execute anything. It does NOT need a runtime. It gets fed TO the subject agent via the AgentRuntime.

### Components

ix defines components that implement Matrix's Component protocol. Each component decides what goes into the Construct:

**SubjectRunner** — feeds probes to the subject via AgentRuntime:

\`\`\`python
class SubjectRunner:
    def __init__(self, runtime: AgentRuntimePort):
        self.runtime = runtime

    async def run(self, construct: Construct) -> list[dict]:
        subject = construct.subject
        probes = construct.last("probes")
        results = []
        for probe in probes:
            response = await self.runtime.invoke(
                system=subject.system_prompt,
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": probe}],
            )
            results.append({"probe": probe, "response": response})
        return results
\`\`\`

**Grader (LLM-as-judge)** — evaluates responses via AgentRuntime with a rubric as system prompt:

\`\`\`python
class LLMJudgeGrader:
    def __init__(self, runtime: AgentRuntimePort, rubric: str):
        self.runtime = runtime
        self.rubric = rubric

    async def run(self, construct: Construct) -> list[dict]:
        responses = construct.last("subject.responses")
        grades = []
        for entry in responses:
            grade = await self.runtime.invoke(
                system=self.rubric,
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": entry["response"]}],
            )
            grades.append({"grade": grade})
        return grades
\`\`\`

**Rule-based Grader** — no runtime needed:

\`\`\`python
class ActivationGrader:
    async def run(self, construct: Construct) -> list[dict]:
        responses = construct.last("subject.responses")
        return [{"passed": "Skill" in r["response"]} for r in responses]
\`\`\`

Same \`AgentRuntimePort.invoke()\` for both SubjectRunner and LLMJudgeGrader. Different system prompt. Different input. Same mechanism.

### Experiment State Machine

ix uses pytransitions for experiment lifecycle management:

\`\`\`python
from transitions import Machine

states = ['idle', 'probing', 'sensing', 'scoring', 'reporting', 'completed', 'failed']

transitions = [
    {'trigger': 'start',         'source': 'idle',      'dest': 'probing'},
    {'trigger': 'probes_done',   'source': 'probing',   'dest': 'sensing'},
    {'trigger': 'sensors_done',  'source': 'sensing',   'dest': 'probing',
     'conditions': ['has_more_trials']},
    {'trigger': 'sensors_done',  'source': 'sensing',   'dest': 'scoring',
     'unless': ['has_more_trials']},
    {'trigger': 'scores_done',   'source': 'scoring',   'dest': 'reporting'},
    {'trigger': 'report_done',   'source': 'reporting', 'dest': 'completed'},
    {'trigger': 'fail',          'source': '*',          'dest': 'failed'},
]
\`\`\`

Callbacks drive the components: \`on_enter_probing\` triggers SubjectRunner, \`on_enter_sensing\` triggers the Grader, etc.

### Experiment Configuration

\`\`\`yaml
name: "Skill Activation Quality"
hypothesis: "build-eval skill activates for eval-related prompts"

conditions:
  - id: "with-skill"
    subject:
      kind: "agent"
      name: "claude-with-build-eval"
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
      system_prompt: "You are a helpful assistant."
      tools: ["Skill", "Read", "Write"]
      skills: ["build-eval"]

scenario:
  kind: "cognitive_task"
  task_prompt: "How do I write evals?"
  expected:
    activated: true

graders:
  - id: "activation"
    type: "activation"
    config:
      expected_skill: "build-eval"

runs_per_condition: 5
\`\`\`

## The Execution Flow

\`\`\`
1. User runs: ix run experiment.yaml

2. ix loads config, creates experiment state machine

3. ix registers components in Matrix:
   - SubjectRunner (needs AgentRuntime)
   - Grader (needs AgentRuntime if LLM-judge, or rule-based)
   - Scorer (row-level + aggregate)
   - Reporter (console, JSON, HTML)

4. State machine drives execution:

   idle ──start──> probing
                    │
                    │  For each (probe x condition x trial):
                    │    SubjectRunner feeds probe to subject via AgentRuntime
                    │    Response appended to Construct as Artifact
                    │
                    ▼
                  sensing
                    │
                    │  For each response:
                    │    Grader evaluates (LLM-judge or rule-based)
                    │    Grade appended to Construct as Artifact
                    │
                    ▼
              ┌─ has more trials? ──> back to probing
              │
              └─ all done ──> scoring
                                │
                                │  Row scores: pass/fail per trial
                                │  Aggregate scores: F1, pass@k, Bayesian CI
                                │
                                ▼
                             reporting
                                │
                                │  Console output, JSON, HTML
                                │
                                ▼
                             completed

5. ix reads Construct, extracts results:
   intent, construct = await matrix.run(experiment)
   scores = construct.last("scorer.row_scores")
   metrics = compute_f1(scores)

# ix: Intelligent Experimentation

- Start Date: 2026-02-08
- Status: Draft

## Summary

ix is an experimentation framework for collaborative intelligence systems. It converts intent into evidence through a four-phase lifecycle — **Goal → Design → Run → Analysis** — where the developer and Claude Code collaborate at every stage.

The developer has a goal — a hardened hypothesis: "Adding skill B degrades skill A." ix provides the structure to validate or refute it rigorously — experiment design with proper controls, reproducible execution, Bayesian statistics for small-N confidence intervals, and transparent artifacts the developer can inspect and interpret.

M1 focuses on agentic experiments: evaluating skills, agents, and cognitive extensions within Claude Code. But the framework is designed for any experiment where you need reproducible structure around stochastic or variable subjects — services, cloud resources, human workflows.

## Motivation

### The measurement problem in collaborative intelligence

Collaborative intelligence systems combine human judgment with AI capability. Extensions — skills, agents, hooks, commands — amplify human capability. But how do you know they work?

Claude Code orchestrates intelligently but non-reproducibly. Run the same prompt twice, get different tool call sequences, different reasoning paths, different answers. That's fine for work. It's useless for measurement.

If you want to know whether adding skill B degrades skill A's activation precision, you need:

- **Multiple trials** — agents are stochastic, one run proves nothing
- **A control condition** — skill A alone vs skill A+B
- **Statistical rigor** — confidence intervals, not point estimates
- **Reproducible structure** — the variance you observe should come from the subject, not the framework
- **Collaboration** — the developer and Claude Code interpreting results together, not a tool printing numbers

### The state of evaluation

The LLM evaluation landscape treats evaluation as testing: pass/fail assertions, binary outcomes, single runs. Meanwhile:

- Anthropic's "Adding Error Bars to Evals" showed clustered standard errors can be over 3x larger than naive standard errors (arXiv 2411.00640)
- An ICML 2025 Spotlight paper demonstrated CLT-based confidence intervals fail for small-N evals — the majority of real-world cases (arXiv 2503.01747)
- ReliabilityBench showed task perturbations alone reduce agent success from 96.9% to 88.1% (arXiv 2601.06112)

The research community knows the problem. Existing frameworks don't solve it. And none of them treat experimentation as a collaborative activity between human and AI.

### Use cases

**Skill activation precision.** Does the agent activate the right skill for a given context? Run 50 test cases across 5 trials, compute F1 with Bayesian confidence intervals.

**Coexistence testing.** Does adding skill B degrade skill A? Compare A-alone (control) against A+B (treatment) with paired statistical testing.

**Context degradation.** How does agent behavior degrade after N tool calls? Measure quality across conversation lengths.

**Comparative experiments.** Compare control + N variant conditions systematically. Not A/B — control + N.

**Capability testing.** Does the CLI handle edge-case inputs? Does the API meet latency SLAs under load? Same experimentation lifecycle, different execution backend — CLI/API/HTTP harness instead of Agent SDK.

**Extension effectiveness.** Does this cognitive extension actually make the developer more capable over time? The ultimate CI question — longitudinal, the hardest experiment to design.

### Gaps in existing frameworks

Based on landscape analysis across 42 sources (February 2026):

| Gap | Closest Existing | What's Missing |
|-----|-----------------|----------------|
| Collaborative experiment lifecycle | Nothing | No framework involves human + AI in design/analysis |
| Skill activation evaluation | Nothing | No framework tests "did the right skill activate?" |
| Coexistence testing | Nothing | No framework tests "does skill B degrade skill A?" |
| Bayesian statistics as default | \`bayes_evals\` (library, not framework) | No framework ships small-N CIs out of the box |
| Comparative experiments (control + N) | Braintrust (A/B only, commercial) | No open-source framework supports N-way comparison |
| Context degradation measurement | Nothing | Ad hoc testing only |

## Guide-level explanation

### The experimentation lifecycle

ix structures experimentation as four collaborative phases:

\`\`\`
Goal ──→ Design ──→ Run ──→ Analysis
  ↑          ↑        ↑        ↑
  human   human+ix   ix     human+ix
\`\`\`

**Goal.** The developer has a hypothesis to validate. "Skill B degrades skill A's activation precision." "The agent fails on ambiguous prompts after 10 tool calls." "The new model regresses on tool selection for data-store queries." A Goal in ix is hardened intent — specific enough to test, falsifiable enough to disprove. Goals decompose into Experiments.

**Design.** Claude Code and the developer collaborate on experiment design. ix provides the vocabulary: what are you measuring (sensor), what stimulus are you applying (probe), what conditions are you comparing (subjects), how many trials do you need (power analysis). The developer makes the judgment calls. ix makes sure the experiment is sound.

**Run.** ix executes the experiment. Reproducible structure, transparent artifacts, no hidden state. The developer can watch, pause, inspect intermediate results. The execution is deterministic even when the subject is stochastic — the variance you observe comes from what you're measuring, not how you're measuring it.

**Analysis.** ix computes statistics — Bayesian CIs, F1, pass@k. But numbers aren't answers. Claude Code and the developer interpret together: What does 73% activation precision with CI [0.65, 0.81] mean for this skill? Is that good enough? What's the failure mode? The framework provides evidence. The collaboration produces understanding.

### Experiment, not eval

ix runs experiments, not evals. The distinction matters:

| Eval | Experiment |
|------|-----------|
| Pass/fail assertion | Hypothesis with conditions |
| Single run | Multiple trials |
| Point estimate | Confidence interval |
| Binary outcome | Evidence for interpretation |
| Automated judgment | Collaborative analysis |

An eval tells you "this passed." An experiment tells you "under these conditions, with this confidence, here's what we observed — what should we conclude?"

### Agentic experiments (M1)

The first class of experiments ix supports: evaluating AI skills, agents, and cognitive extensions within Claude Code.

An agentic experiment uses a DAG execution engine (Matrix) to run probes against subjects through controlled trials:

\`\`\`python
# The developer and Claude Code design this together
experiment = Experiment(
    name="skill-activation-eval",
    probes=[...],       # stimulus: test cases
    subjects=[...],     # SUT: agent + skill configurations
    sensors=[...],      # observation: what to measure
    scorers=[...],      # judgment: per-trial pass/fail
    trials=5,           # repetition: handle stochasticity
    reporter=Console()  # output: how to present results
)

# ix executes with reproducible structure
results = await experiment.run()

# Developer and Claude Code interpret together
# "73% activation, CI [0.65, 0.81] — is that acceptable?"
\`\`\`

**Why a DAG?** Probes, sensors, and scorers declare their dependencies. ix compiles these into a directed acyclic graph and executes in topological order. Independent nodes run in parallel. Every node produces an artifact file. The structure is deterministic even when individual nodes involve stochastic agents.

### Running an experiment

You write a YAML config:

\`\`\`yaml
name: "skill-activation-eval"

subjects:
  - name: "claude-with-build-eval"
    model: "claude-sonnet-4.5"
    skills: ["build-eval"]

probes:
  - file: "cases/must-activate/eval-framework-question.md"
    expectation: "must_trigger"
  - file: "cases/should-not/unrelated-coding-question.md"
    expectation: "should_not_trigger"

trials: 5

sensors:
  - type: "activation"
    target_skill: "build-eval"

scorers:
  - type: "passfail"

reporters:
  - type: "console"
\`\`\`

ix reads this, designs the execution graph, runs it N times, aggregates results. Claude Code is the user — humans talk to Claude Code, Claude Code configures and runs ix.

### Agents are markdown files

Probe agents, sensor agents — these are markdown files with system prompts and task prompts. The execution engine loads them and runs them as subagents via the Agent SDK.

\`\`\`markdown
---
name: rubric-sensor
model: claude-sonnet-4.5
---

You are evaluating whether an agent's response meets quality criteria.

## Rubric
- **Correctness**: Did the agent produce the right answer?
- **Completeness**: Did the agent address all parts?

Grade on a 0-10 scale. Explain your reasoning.

## Task
Evaluate: {{observation.content}}
Expected: {{probe.expected}}
\`\`\`

### Domains build on the core ontology

The core experimentation vocabulary — Probe, Sensor, Scorer, Reporter, Subject, Trial — is domain-agnostic. It describes the universal structure of experimentation: apply stimulus, observe, judge, report.

Domains specialize this vocabulary for their practitioners:

| Core (ix) | Agentic Evals | Capability Testing |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Probe | Case | Request |
| Sensor | Grader | HealthCheck |
| Scorer | Scorer | SLA Checker |
| Subject | Agent / Skill | CLI / API / Service |
| Trial | Run | Call |

Agentic evals say "Case" and "Grader" because that's what eval practitioners say. Capability testing says "Request" and "HealthCheck." Both map onto the same core: stimulus → observation → judgment.

This is why the build-eval skill uses "Grader" and ix uses "Sensor" — they're different layers. The skill speaks the eval domain. ix speaks the experimentation core.

### Execution backends

Each domain has its natural execution backend:

| Domain | Execution Backend | Subject |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Agentic Evals | Matrix (DAG + Agent SDK) | Skills, agents, extensions |
| Capability Testing | CLI/API/HTTP/gRPC harness | CLIs, APIs, services, cloud resources |

The core ontology stays the same. The domain vocabulary and execution backend change.

## Reference-level explanation

### Core ontology

These are ix's foundational concepts. They describe the universal structure of experimentation — domain-agnostic, backend-agnostic:

| Term | What it is | Role in lifecycle |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Probe** | Stimulus applied to the subject | Design: what question are we asking? |
| **Subject** | System under test (SUT) | Design: what are we testing? |
| **Trial** | One execution of probe against subject | Run: a single observation |
| **Sensor** | Observer that measures trial output | Run: what are we measuring? |
| **Scorer** | Judgment on a single trial | Run: pass/fail per observation |
| **Reporter** | Output formatting | Analysis: how to present results |

### Experiment properties

Experiments are characterized by three properties, not categories:

- \`deterministic(subject)\` — is the subject deterministic? (LLMs: no. HTTP status codes: mostly yes.)
- \`has_ground_truth\` — do we know the right answer? (Activation: yes. Quality: no, need LLM-as-judge.)
- \`min_trials\` — how many repetitions? (Deterministic: 1. Stochastic: ≥5, guided by power analysis.)

Comparative experiments add a control condition and N variants. Not A/B testing — control + N.

### Agentic execution engine (Matrix)

For agentic experiments, ix uses Matrix — a kind-agnostic DAG runner that provides deterministic structure around stochastic agents.

**Matrix types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| \`Artifact\` | Atomic immutable fact. \`kind\`, \`producer\`, \`data\`, \`id\`, \`created_at\`. |
| \`Intent[S]\` | Frozen recipe. Subject + component names. For replay. |
| \`Construct[S]\` | Append-only ledger of artifacts. \`construct.append(artifact)\` returns new instance. |
| \`Component\` | Protocol: \`name\`, \`requires: frozenset[str]\`, \`provides: str\`, \`async run(construct) → data\`. |

The Component protocol uses \`typing.Protocol\` with \`@runtime_checkable\`. Structural subtyping — implement without importing Matrix.

**Matrix infrastructure:**

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| \`DagCompiler\` | Validates topology from component declarations. Produces dependency graph. |
| \`DagScheduler\` | Yields execution batches in topological order. Parallel within levels. |
| \`Orchestrator\` | Compiles + schedules + executes. The run loop. |
| \`AgentRuntime\` | Protocol: \`invoke(system, messages) → str\`. Backend-agnostic. |

**ix maps its vocabulary to Matrix components:**

| Kind | requires | provides | Agent? |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Probe** | \`{}\` | \`"probe.stimulus"\` | Maybe (can be data or agent) |
| **Subject** | \`{}\` | \`"subject.config"\` | No |
| **Trial** | \`{"probe.stimulus", "subject.config"}\` | \`"trial.observation"\` | Yes (calls AgentRuntime) |
| **Sensor** | \`{"trial.observation"}\` | \`"sensor.reading"\` | Maybe (rule-based or LLM-as-judge) |
| **Scorer** | \`{"sensor.reading"}\` | \`"scorer.verdict"\` | No |
| **Reporter** | \`{"scorer.verdict"}\` | \`"reporter.output"\` | No |

Matrix knows nothing about probes or experiments. Import rule: \`ix → matrix\`. Never \`matrix → ix\`.

### Scorer split model

Row scorers and aggregate scorers are separated:

**Row Scorers** — in the execution graph. Per-trial pass/fail. Enable fast-fail on catastrophic failure.

**Aggregate Scorers** — post-execution. F1, pass@k, Bayesian CI across all trials. Run by ix after execution completes.

Why the split:
1. Aggregate in execution = O(N) memory holding all trial results
2. Raw scores must persist before aggregation (audit trail)
3. Execution produces evidence (per-trial). Post-processing produces statistics. Keep them separate.

### Sensor types

Grader is collapsed into Sensor. Grading IS evaluative sensing.

| Sensor | Agent? | What it observes |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| \`ActivationSensor\` | No | Whether a skill was activated (rule-based tool call check) |
| \`LLMJudgeSensor\` | Yes | Quality evaluation via LLM-as-judge rubric |

### Artifact persistence

Every step produces artifacts — files written to the filesystem during execution.

\`\`\`

\`\`\`

Artifacts are the transparency mechanism. The developer can inspect any intermediate result: what probe fired, what the agent responded, what the sensor measured, what the scorer decided. No hidden state.

## Drawbacks

**Complexity for simple checks.** If you just want to check whether an LLM output matches an expected string, ix is overkill. A pytest suite with \`assert\` statements is simpler. ix is for when you need to answer a question, not pass a test.

**Statistical literacy required.** Bayesian credible intervals require different mental models than point estimates. The collaboration model helps — Claude Code can explain results — but the developer needs enough statistical intuition to ask the right questions.

**M1 scope limitation.** Only agentic evals are supported initially. Capability testing (CLIs, APIs, services) requires an additional execution backend.

**Agent SDK dependency.** Agentic experiments require the Claude Agent SDK. This couples M1 to Anthropic's ecosystem. Alternative runtimes (OpenAI, local models) require additional adapters.

## Rationale and alternatives

### Why a lifecycle, not just an executor?

**Experimentation is collaborative.** Designing a good experiment requires human judgment about what to measure and what constitutes success. Interpreting results requires domain knowledge. ix structures this collaboration rather than just running code.

**Goal → Evidence, not Config → Output.** The framework should help the developer formulate the right experiment, not just execute whatever they configure. Design assistance (power analysis, suggesting controls) is as important as execution.

**Alternative considered:** Just build a better eval runner. Rejected because execution without collaboration produces numbers without understanding. The CI thesis demands that both human and AI get smarter through the process.

### Why DAG orchestration for agentic experiments?

**Parallelism.** Independent probes execute concurrently. Sensors can process observations in parallel.

**Composability.** New component kinds plug in without changing the engine.

**Fast-fail.** Row scorers enable branch pruning on catastrophic failure.

**Clarity.** The dependency graph makes experiment structure explicit and inspectable.

**Alternative considered:** Linear pipeline (like Inspect AI's solver chain). Rejected because it can't express parallel execution or branching topologies.

### Why artifacts as files?

**Transparency.** Inspect intermediate results without re-running. \`jq .score artifacts/scorer.verdict/001-trial-1.json\`.

**Tool compatibility.** Files work with existing analysis tools — jq, DuckDB, pandas, Excel.

**Simplicity.** No database for M1. Files are the simplest persistence that works.

**Alternative considered:** DuckDB from day 1. Deferred to future historical regression tracking.

### Why Bayesian over frequentist?

**Small-N reality.** Most real-world evals have fewer than a few hundred datapoints. CLT assumptions fail.

**Proper uncertainty.** Bayesian credible intervals have correct coverage for small samples where frequentist CIs are too narrow.

**Alternative considered:** Frequentist with clustered SEs (Anthropic's approach). Not rejected — ix supports both. Bayesian is the default because small-N is the common case.

### Why domains over a monolithic vocabulary?

**Practitioners think in their domain.** Eval people say "case" and "grader." Service people say "request" and "health check." Forcing everyone into one vocabulary creates friction. Domains let each field use its natural language while sharing the same experimentation structure underneath.

**The core stays small.** Six concepts (Probe, Sensor, Scorer, Reporter, Subject, Trial) plus the lifecycle (Goal → Experiment). Everything else is domain-specific. Small core = less to learn, easier to extend.

**Execution backends follow domains.** Agentic evals need Agent SDK. Capability testing needs CLI/API/HTTP harnesses. The domain determines the backend, not the other way around.

**Alternative considered:** One vocabulary for everything. Rejected because "Case" means something specific to eval practitioners that "Probe" doesn't capture, and vice versa. The mapping exists, but forcing one over the other loses domain precision.

## Prior art

### Inspect AI (UK AISI)

The closest existing framework architecturally. Agent Bridge drives external agent processes. Epochs parameter enables multi-trial. Bootstrap CIs for confidence intervals.

**What ix borrows:** Agent Bridge pattern (drive Claude Code externally), TaskState + store.

**Where ix diverges:** Inspect's execution model is a linear solver chain, not a DAG. No collaborative design phase. No support for parallel execution or comparative experiments. Bootstrap CIs (frequentist), not Bayesian.

### Anthropic's methodology

Two publications inform ix directly:

**"Adding Error Bars to Evals"** (Nov 2024): Clustered SEs, paired differences, power analysis. ix adopts all three.

**"Demystifying Evals for AI Agents"** (Jan 2026): Task/Trial/Transcript/Outcome vocabulary. pass@k and pass^k. "Grade outcomes, not transcripts." ix adopts this methodology.

Anthropic chose to endorse Inspect AI rather than build a general-purpose eval framework. Their open-source tools (Bloom, Petri, SHADE-Arena) are domain-specific.

### DeepEval

DAG metrics (decision tree evaluation logic), not DAG orchestration. The DAG is inside the scorer, not across the experiment. 12.8k GitHub stars, strong CI/CD integration.

### Promptfoo

YAML config, CI/CD integration, 88k weekly npm downloads. No statistical rigor. No Bayesian CIs. No comparative experiments.

### Braintrust

A/B experiment comparison, but commercial and limited to two variants. ix supports control + N variants.

### bayes_evals

Python library providing Bayesian CIs for LLM evals (from ICML 2025 paper authors). Functions: \`independent_intervals\`, \`independent_comparisons\`, \`paired_comparisons\`. ix integrates these as aggregate scorers.

### lab-1337

Research prototype that ix refines. Discovered: task difficulty dominates prompting strategy, no single condition wins globally, multi-level grading = one sensor with multi-dimensional score (not multiple sensors).

## Unresolved questions

**Execution backend interface.** What's the common protocol between Matrix (agentic) and future backends (service, infrastructure)? How much do they share vs diverge?

**Design assistance scope.** How much should ix help with experiment design? Power analysis is straightforward. Suggesting appropriate controls requires domain knowledge. Where's the line between framework assistance and requiring a statistics background?

**N probes x M subjects.** How does the cross-product work? One execution per (probe, subject) pair? All combinations in a single run?

**Experiment state machine.** M1 uses a simple loop. When does a proper state machine (PENDING → RUNNING → ANALYZING → COMPLETE → FAILED) become necessary?

**Config schema.** The experiment YAML schema is not formally defined. Pydantic models exist for domain objects but not for the config surface area.

## Future possibilities

**Capability testing (M2).** CLI, API, HTTP, gRPC subjects. Same core ontology, different execution backend.

**Historical regression tracking.** DuckDB persistence for cross-experiment comparison. "Did this week's build regress on activation precision?"

**Benchmark experiments.** Standardized experiment configs for common evaluation scenarios.

**Collaborative intelligence evaluation (M3).** Longitudinal measurement of whether extensions make humans more capable — the ultimate measure of the CI thesis. The hardest experiment to design: human learning is slow, confounded, and hard to isolate.

**Inspect AI interoperability.** Bloom exports Inspect-compatible JSON. ix should export the same format for ecosystem compatibility.

**Message Batches API.** Anthropic's Batches API offers 50% cost reduction. ix should support batched execution for large experiment suites.

`,Gc=`# The Productivity Paradox

AI tools make developers feel faster while measurably slowing them down.

---

You're shipping features faster than ever. Code appears on your screen at the speed of thought. Pull requests stack up. The backlog shrinks. Your manager is impressed. You're convinced AI has made you 20-30% more productive.

Then someone measures it.

You're 19% slower. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="METR RCT, n=16, within-subject design">◐</span>

This isn't a measurement error. It's not about you being bad at using AI. This is what happens when experienced developers work with AI in their own codebases — the repositories they know best, doing work they've done hundreds of times before.

The gap between what you feel and what measurement shows isn't small. It's 43 percentage points. You predicted you'd be 24% faster. You were actually 19% slower. That's not miscalibration. That's systematic perceptual blindness.

## The Invisible Work

Here's what happens in practice.

**Without AI:**
- You think about the problem for 15 minutes
- You write 50 lines of code in 20 minutes
- You test it locally for 10 minutes
- Total: 45 minutes, 50 LOC

**With AI:**
- You craft a prompt for 5 minutes
- AI generates 200 lines in 10 seconds
- You read through it for 8 minutes
- You realize it doesn't integrate with your existing auth system
- You adjust the prompt for 3 minutes
- AI generates another 180 lines in 10 seconds
- You read through it for 10 minutes
- You manually fix integration issues for 12 minutes
- You test locally for 15 minutes (more code to test)
- You discover a subtle bug from the generated code
- You debug for 8 minutes
- Total: 61 minutes, 180 LOC

You *feel* productive because code appeared fast. You *are* slower because verification, integration, and debugging expanded to fill the time saved in generation.

The work didn't disappear. It shifted from visible creation to invisible validation. Your brain counts the 10 seconds of generation. It undercounts the 53 minutes of everything else.

## The Quality Signal

This would just be a time-tracking curiosity if the code quality stayed constant. It doesn't.

Analysis of 211 million lines of code before and after AI adoption found an 8x increase in code duplication. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="GitClear longitudinal analysis, 211M LOC">●</span> Refactoring activity — the commits where developers consolidate patterns and improve abstractions — plummeted.

Why? Because AI generates code without awareness of existing implementations. Every time you ask for a solution, you get a fresh implementation. The human instinct would be to search the codebase for similar logic and reuse it. The AI instinct is to generate plausible new code.

And here's the trap: accepting that new code is faster than searching for, understanding, and integrating the existing solution. The individual decision is rational. The cumulative effect is a codebase that shifts from *designed architecture* to *assembled components*.

You notice this six months later when you're debugging and discover four different implementations of "validate email address," each with slightly different behavior, none of them extracted to a shared utility.

## The Security Compounding

The duplication story is bad. The security story is worse.

Forty-five percent of AI-generated code contains critical vulnerabilities. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Veracode static analysis">◐</span> Not sophisticated zero-days. Basic mistakes: hardcoded credentials, SQL injection from string concatenation, missing input validation.

Your instinct says: "I'll just iterate until it's secure." The data says that makes it worse.

Initial AI-generated code averages 2.1 vulnerabilities per 1,000 lines. After iterative refinement — you know, the thing we're told makes AI safer — that number becomes 6.2. Each round adds code without removing vulnerabilities from previous rounds. The human reviewing iteration 3 has more surface area to check and less understanding of what changed.

This isn't AI being malicious. It's AI inheriting patterns from training data that includes vulnerable code, and humans losing comprehension as the generated codebase grows beyond what they can reason about.

## The Comprehension Gap

Here's the long-term problem.

When you write code yourself, you understand 100% of it. That understanding compounds. Each function you write makes the next function easier because you grasp how the pieces fit together.

When AI writes code and you review it, you understand maybe 60% on first read — enough to ship it, not enough to maintain it. The next feature builds on that 60%-understood code, and your comprehension drops to 30%. By sprint 4, you're debugging a codebase you don't fully understand, built on abstractions you didn't design, with patterns you can't predict.

This shows up in DORA metrics — the industry-wide measures of software delivery performance. Teams adopting AI show a 7.2% decline in deployment stability and a 1.5% reduction in throughput. Not massive. Not catastrophic. But the opposite direction of what we expected.

The productivity gain in generation becomes a productivity loss in maintenance. The code still has to be maintained. The developer who didn't deeply understand it during generation won't magically understand it six months later when the bug report comes in.

## Why You Can't Trust Your Perception

Here's the hardest part: you cannot trust your own feeling of productivity.

The METR study didn't just measure time. It asked developers to predict how much faster they'd be with AI. The predictions were consistently wrong. These weren't junior developers on toy problems. These were experienced maintainers working in their own repositories.

The miscalibration isn't stupidity. It's how expertise works. You accurately perceive the reduction in *effort during generation*. You systematically undercount the expansion in *effort during verification*. Your brain notices the endorphin hit of code appearing on screen. It doesn't track the cumulative cost of prompting, reading, integrating, testing, and debugging.

This creates a self-sustaining illusion. If you believe you're faster, you won't measure. If you don't measure, you won't discover the gap. The feeling substitutes for the fact.

Stack Overflow's survey data captures this at scale: AI adoption rose from 76% to 84% while trust in AI accuracy fell from 43% to 33%. Adoption increases. Trust decreases. People use tools they don't trust because the perception of productivity overrides the measurement of performance.

## What Actually Works

This isn't a "never use AI" argument. Specific tasks show genuine gains. Boilerplate generation saves real time. Code translation between languages works. API exploration and prototyping accelerate onboarding.

The pattern: AI helps when the task is generation-heavy, verification-light, and maintenance burden is low. One-off scripts, throwaway prototypes, repetitive boilerplate — these benefit from AI.

AI struggles when the task requires long-term maintenance, deep integration with existing systems, or security-critical correctness. Complex systems with multi-year lifespans pay the comprehension tax every time someone has to debug, extend, or secure the AI-generated code.

The catch: you can't know which category you're in without measurement. Your perception will tell you it's working. The data might disagree.

## The Design Implication

If you're building tools for developers, this paradox shapes everything.

**Don't optimize for speed.** Optimize for comprehension. The bottleneck isn't how fast code appears. It's whether the human understands what appeared.

**Make the invisible visible.** Track time spent prompting, reviewing, and fixing — not just time spent generating. Developers can't calibrate without seeing total effort.

**Verify independently.** The human reviewing AI output needs separation from the generation process. Bundling them compounds the illusion.

**Surface quality, not quantity.** Lines of code generated is a vanity metric. Duplication, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability matter.

The goal isn't to make developers write more code faster. The goal is to help them build systems they can understand, maintain, and evolve without accumulating technical debt at the speed of AI.

---

The productivity paradox isn't that AI doesn't help. It's that the help creates costs that perception can't see and measurement reveals too late. By the time you discover the code quality degradation, the security vulnerabilities, and the comprehension gap, they're already compounding.

The question isn't whether AI makes you feel productive. The question is whether it makes you *actually* productive — and whether you'd know the difference.

`,jc=`# Skill Formation

The interaction pattern, not the technology, determines whether you learn.

---

You're learning a new Python library. You've never used Trio before—async programming, concurrency, error handling patterns all new to you. You have two hours to build a working prototype.

You could grind through the docs, hit errors, debug stack traces, slowly piece together how it works. Or you could ask Claude to generate the code, paste it in, ship it.

Both get you to working code. Only one leaves you more capable.

## The Six Patterns

Anthropic ran an experiment with 52 software engineers learning Trio. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="RCT, n=52, Anthropic 2026">◐</span> Same AI assistant. Same task. Six different ways people chose to interact.

Three patterns preserved learning. Three destroyed it.

**Generation-Then-Comprehension** (86% mastery): Generate code with AI, then ask follow-up questions to understand what it did. "Why did you use \`trio.open_nursery()\` here? What happens if I remove this line?"

**Hybrid Code-Explanation** (68% mastery): Request explanations alongside code. "Show me how to handle timeouts in Trio and explain when each pattern applies."

**Conceptual Inquiry** (65% mastery): Only ask conceptual questions. Write all code yourself. "What's the difference between structured and unstructured concurrency?"

These three patterns have something in common: errors. Users hit TypeError exceptions, RuntimeWarnings, async context issues. They debugged them. That debugging is where learning happened.

Now the three patterns that failed:

**AI Delegation** (39% mastery): Ask AI to generate code, paste it, move on. Fastest completion time (19.5 minutes). Worst learning outcome.

**Progressive Reliance** (35% mastery): Start writing code yourself, gradually hand more to the AI as you realize it's faster. Watch your understanding erode in real-time.

**Iterative Debugging** (24% mastery): Have AI fix your errors without understanding what broke or why the fix works. The error message becomes a handoff, not a learning signal.

The gap between best and worst: **86% vs 24%**. Same AI. Same task. Different interaction choices.

## Errors Are the Curriculum

The control group—no AI access—encountered a median of 3 errors during the task. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Same RCT, n=52">◐</span> The AI group encountered 1.

Those two extra errors weren't obstacles. They were the lesson.

When you hit \`TypeError: 'async for' requires an object with __aiter__ method\`, you learn something about Python's async protocol. When you see \`RuntimeWarning: Trio cannot be run from a running event loop\`, you learn about execution contexts. When your timeout doesn't work, you learn about cancellation scopes.

AI users who delegated never encountered these. They copied working code and moved on. The code ran. They learned nothing about why.

The errors weren't bugs in the process. The errors *were* the process.

## What People Noticed

The participants who delegated to AI knew something was wrong:

- "I feel like I got lazy"
- "There are still a lot of gaps in my understanding"
- "I wish I'd taken the time to understand the explanations more"

They completed the task. They passed the immediate test—ship working code. But they failed the actual test: can you do this again without the AI?

The mastery assessment came later, after the task, without AI access. That's where the 86% vs 24% gap appeared. The people who delegated couldn't reconstruct what they'd built. They'd outsourced not just the typing, but the thinking.

## Productivity vs Capability

The AI Delegation pattern produced the fastest task completion. It also produced the worst learning.

The Generation-Then-Comprehension pattern took 23% longer. It produced 2.2x better learning outcomes.

This is the tradeoff: you can optimize for speed today or capability tomorrow.

If you're learning something new—a framework, a library, a domain—the interaction pattern determines which path you're on:

**Path 1: Capability compounds**
You generate code with AI, then interrogate it. Why this pattern? What does this function do? What happens if I change this parameter? You hit errors. You debug them. You emerge able to work in this domain with or without AI.

**Path 2: Dependency compounds**
You ask AI to solve the problem. You paste the solution. You move to the next problem. You complete tasks faster. Your ability to work independently atrophies. Six months later, you can't remember how any of it works without the AI.

The gap between these paths is measurable. It's not subtle. It's 86% mastery vs 24%.

## The Mechanism

Why does Generation-Then-Comprehension work when AI Delegation fails?

The difference is **error exposure**.

When you generate code and then ask questions, you're still in the loop. You see what the AI produced. You ask why. Those questions create cognitive load. You're forced to reconcile the code with your mental model. The mismatch triggers learning.

When you debug errors—even AI-generated code—you're building pattern recognition. This error message maps to this mistake. This warning means I misunderstood this concept. Over time, you internalize the library's execution model.

When you delegate fully, none of this happens. The code works. Your mental model stays shallow. You never reconcile anything because you never look closely enough to notice the gaps.

The AI becomes a black box. Put problem in, get solution out. Learning requires opening the box.

## What This Means

If you're building something you already know how to build, AI acceleration makes sense. Generate, review, ship.

If you're learning something new, the pattern shifts:

1. **Ask the AI to generate**, but don't stop there
2. **Ask follow-up questions** about what it produced
3. **Let errors happen**—they're teaching you
4. **Debug with understanding**, not just iteration

The goal isn't to avoid AI. The goal is to use it in ways that make you more capable, not more dependent.

The difference between 86% and 24% mastery is entirely within your control. It's not about the AI. It's about how you choose to interact with it.

When independent researchers study AI from different angles, they keep finding the same pattern.

## Five Converging Findings

### Same Tool, Opposite Outcomes

The first surprise: identical AI access produces radically different results depending on how people engage with it. Anthropic researchers tracked 52 engineers learning a new library with AI help. Six patterns emerged. The highest-mastery pattern — generate code first, then ask follow-up questions — led to 86% task success. The lowest — use AI to iteratively debug errors — produced 24% success. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="RCT, n=52, single study">◐</span>

This wasn't about the AI's capability. Everyone used the same tool. The interaction model determined whether people learned or offloaded.

A larger education study confirmed this at scale. When 1,000 students used unrestricted ChatGPT for practice problems, they scored 17% worse on exams. When the same technology included guardrails that required active engagement, exam scores matched students who never used AI at all. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="RCT, n=1,000, PNAS peer-reviewed">●</span>

Design shapes outcome. The hypothesis isn't "AI harms learning" — it's "substitutive engagement harms learning while complementary engagement preserves it."

[Read the full skill formation evidence →](../reference/skill-formation-evidence)

### Measurable Cognitive Shifts

When researchers measure what happens inside people's heads during AI use, they find systematic changes. Knowledge workers who trust AI more show measurably less critical thinking (β = -0.69). EEG studies during AI-assisted writing reveal reduced memory encoding — 83% of users couldn't recall quotes from their own AI-assisted essays. Medical studies show endoscopists' unaided polyp detection dropping 20% after three months of AI assistance.

Four independent studies, different methods, different domains. The pattern holds: cognitive offloading is real and measurable. Neural connectivity scales down. Skills atrophy from disuse. The engagement shift from execution to oversight happens without corresponding increases in verification rigor.

[Read the full cognitive effects evidence →](../reference/cognitive-effects-evidence)

### The Gap Between Perception and Reality

Here's the problem with measurable harm: people don't notice it. An experiment with 16 experienced developers predicted they'd be 24% faster with AI. Actual result? 19% slower. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="RCT, n=16, rigorous design">◐</span> The 43-point gap between prediction and reality prevents self-correction.

At scale, Stack Overflow surveys show the paradox: trust in AI accuracy dropped 10 percentage points while adoption rose 8 points. People use tools they don't trust and perceive benefits they don't receive.

Anthropic's analysis of 1.5 million conversations revealed something deeper: users rate disempowering interactions more favorably in the moment. Interactions that distorted reality or substituted judgment felt helpful. But when users acted on those outputs, satisfaction dropped below baseline. The feedback loop is broken — harm feels helpful, so people can't learn from experience.

[Read the full productivity evidence →](../reference/productivity-evidence)

### What Actually Works

A study of 654 professionals found two factors that predict successful AI collaboration: process control (β = 0.507) and transparency (β = 0.415). <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Blaurock et al. 2025, scenario experiments, n=654">◐</span> Control is the strongest lever. Transparency matters. Explanations alone don't help — they increase acceptance regardless of correctness, building trust without calibrating it.

The implication: design must actively counter the perception gap. Users can't reliably judge what helps them because short-term satisfaction diverges from long-term benefit. Transparency and control aren't just nice features — they're necessary to compensate for broken feedback loops.

[Read the full collaboration design evidence →](../reference/collaboration-design-evidence)

### Convergence Toward Consensus

When 70+ different language models answer 26,000 open-ended questions, their outputs cluster into just a few dominant patterns. Temperature and ensembling don't restore diversity — RLHF training penalizes valid but idiosyncratic responses. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="NeurIPS Best Paper, 70+ models">●</span>

A meta-analysis across 28 studies and 8,214 participants quantified the effect: individual creative performance rises slightly while collective diversity drops hard (g = -0.863, a large negative effect). Image generation studies found all 700 iterative loops converged to just 12 motifs regardless of starting prompt. Cultural analysis showed AI pushes writing toward Western norms, dropping classification accuracy from 90.6% to 83.5%.

The diversity that enables collective intelligence — Hong and Page showed diverse groups outperform best-ability groups — disappears when everyone uses the same AI. Individual gains, collective loss.

One study offers hope: using 10 diverse AI personas eliminated the homogenization effect. Design can preserve diversity, but it requires deliberate choice.

[Read the full homogenization evidence →](../reference/homogenization-evidence)

---

## The Pattern

These aren't separate problems. They're facets of the same dynamic:

**Substitutive AI** (does the work for you) improves immediate output while degrading the cognitive foundations that enable long-term capability.

**Complementary AI** (amplifies your work) shows neutral or positive effects on both output and capability.

The evidence comes from different researchers, different methods, different domains. It converges because it's measuring the same underlying pattern from different angles.

One longitudinal study tracked participants for two months after a 7-day AI experiment. Creativity dropped remarkably when AI was withdrawn, and homogeneity kept climbing even months later. The "creative scar" persisted. Users didn't truly acquire capability — they borrowed it, and lost their own in the process.

The research doesn't say AI is harmful. It says the design choice between substitution and complementarity determines whether AI makes humans more capable or more dependent.

Control and transparency aren't just usability features. They're the mechanisms that enable complementary collaboration. The question isn't whether to use AI — it's whether the collaboration is structured to compound human capability or substitute for it.
`,Kc=`# The Path Forward

You've read about the problems. Here's what works.

---

The solutions are as real as the problems. AI that generates code while the human asks follow-up questions produced 86% mastery. AI that generates code and the human accepts it produced 39% mastery. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="RCT, n=52, Anthropic 2026">◐</span> Same technology, different interaction pattern, opposite trajectory.

This isn't theoretical. The evidence base shows what works—Generation-Then-Comprehension, Job Crafting, Mastery Orientation. These aren't expensive or complicated. They require intentionality, not infrastructure.

## Ask Questions After AI Generates

The highest-performing pattern wasn't writing code without AI. It was AI generates, then human comprehends through questioning.

A 2026 Anthropic study tracked how 52 programmers learned to code async patterns:

| Approach | Mastery Score |
|----------|---------------|
| AI generates → human asks follow-up questions | 86% |
| Human writes code, requests explanations | 68% |
| Human writes code themselves (no AI) | 65% |
| Human accepts AI code without questions | 39% |

The 86% group learned more than those who wrote code themselves while completing tasks faster. They got both speed and understanding. The failure mode wasn't accepting AI output—it was accepting without comprehending.

What this looks like in practice:

\`\`\`
✅ "Explain how this async pattern handles cancellation."
✅ "Walk me through why you chose this data structure."
✅ "What edge cases does this miss?"

AI generation is not the problem. Disengagement is the problem.

For novices building foundational understanding, the pattern flips—human generates, AI critiques. This builds generative capability directly. But for established practitioners working in familiar domains, AI generation followed by active comprehension is both faster and more educational.

## Reserve Hard Problems for Yourself

Two developers use AI the same amount. One upskills. One atrophies. The difference isn't usage—it's what they reserve for themselves.

A 2025 study identified two task allocation patterns with opposite outcomes:

**Approach Crafting** — AI handles mundane work, human keeps hard problems:

\`\`\`
AI: Boilerplate, CRUD operations, test scaffolding, formatting
Human: Architecture, domain modeling, edge cases, design decisions
\`\`\`

Result: The human practices hard skills more frequently. AI removes friction that consumed cognitive budget. Skills compound.

**Avoidance Crafting** — AI handles cognitively demanding work:

\`\`\`
AI: Complex algorithms, architecture decisions, debugging hard problems
Human: Review, simple implementations, routine changes
\`\`\`

Result: The human stops practicing the skills that matter most. Capability erodes. AI becomes essential because the human is no longer capable without it.

The goal is more hard problems per day, not fewer. AI should free bandwidth to tackle harder challenges, not eliminate challenge entirely.

When AI offers to handle something, ask: "Is this routine or is this where I learn?"

- Routine → delegate
- Cognitively challenging → keep

## Frame Every Interaction as Learning

Mastery-oriented users maintained critical thinking at 35.7 times the odds of performance-oriented users. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Single study, odds ratio">◐</span> This is the largest effect size in the collaborative AI literature—larger than user control (β = 0.507), larger than transparency (β = 0.415).

The shift is subtle but determinative:

\`\`\`
Performance framing: "Get this done fast."
Mastery framing: "What can I learn from this?"

Performance: "Did it work?"
Mastery: "Why did it work?"

Performance: "Ship and move on."
Mastery: "What's the transferable principle?"
\`\`\`

Extensions designed with mastery framing look different:

\`\`\`
✅ "Let's understand why this approach works..."
✅ "What's the transferable principle here?"
✅ "Where might this pattern break down?"

❌ "Here's the solution."
❌ "This will work."
\`\`\`

The difference between "getting it done" and "learning while getting it done" changes everything.

## Practice Without AI Periodically

Three months of AI-assisted work produces measurable skill degradation. But skills aren't permanently lost—they're dormant. Relearning takes less than 50% of original training time (the Savings Effect). Periodic unassisted work prevents atrophy.

| Frequency | Duration | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Weekly | 2-4 hours | Maintain baseline capability |
| Monthly | Full day | Test independent function |
| Quarterly | Complex task end-to-end | Deep capability assessment |

The work must be cognitively challenging. Doing easy tasks without AI doesn't exercise the skills at risk. Architecture decisions, debugging complex issues, designing from scratch—these maintain the capabilities most vulnerable to atrophy.

This isn't about rejecting AI. It's about preventing the scenario where you can't function without it.

## Use Attempt-First Protocol

Before consulting AI, spend 15-30 minutes attempting the problem independently. The effort itself is valuable, even if the conclusion is wrong.

\`\`\`
Before AI assistance: Work the problem
"What's your diagnosis?"
"Walk me through your approach."
\`\`\`

This preserves problem-solving practice while still leveraging AI for efficiency. You work harder per problem but solve more problems per day. The deliberate struggle is where learning happens.

## Add Metacognitive Checkpoints

Three-phase friction restores critical engagement that AI confidence otherwise suppresses:

| Phase | Checkpoint | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Planning | "What's your approach before I assist?" | Preserves generative step |
| Monitoring | "Does this match what you expected?" | Maintains engagement |
| Evaluation | "What would you change next time?" | Crystallizes learning |

Single-point friction is insufficient. All three phases are needed. Each checkpoint interrupts cognitive offloading and restores active thinking.

## Protect Novices Differently

Direct AI answers harm learning for novices. Hint-only AI shows no harm. The difference is schema formation.

Novices (0-2 years) need to build mental models of program execution, debugging intuition, design reasoning. These form through struggle. Providing solutions prevents formation of the schema that makes someone capable.

\`\`\`
Novice: "How do I handle null?"

❌ "Add if (value != null) on line 12."
✅ "What happens when this function receives null?
    Walk me through the execution."
\`\`\`

For intermediates and experts, full collaboration preserves capability because the schema already exists. The judgment to evaluate AI output is present. For novices, it isn't yet.

Experience level determines appropriate interaction pattern:

| Experience | Recommended Approach | Why |
|-----------|---------------------|-----|
| 0-2 years | Hints, Socratic questions, explanations | Schema formation |
| 2-5 years | Collaboration with verification | Schema reinforcement |
| 5+ years | Full collaboration | Schema robust |

## Surface Uncertainty

Two types of confidence with opposite effects:

| Confidence Type | Impact on Critical Thinking |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| AI-confidence (trust in AI) | β = -0.69 (reduces thinking) |
| Self-confidence (trust in self) | β = +0.35 (increases thinking) |

High AI confidence leads to cognitive offloading. Moderate AI confidence paired with high self-confidence maintains thinking quality.

Design response: reduce AI-confidence signals, boost self-confidence signals.

\`\`\`
❌ "The answer is X." (projects authority)
✅ "Based on what I see, X seems right—but you have
    context I lack. What does your experience suggest?"
\`\`\`

Show reasoning. Acknowledge limits. Invite verification.

## The Scaffolding Metaphor

Scaffolding in construction is temporary support designed to be removed. The goal is a building that stands alone.

AI collaboration should work the same way. Temporary support that enables capability the human couldn't achieve alone—then becomes unnecessary as that capability internalizes.

\`\`\`
Week 1: AI explains async patterns, human doesn't yet understand
Week 4: AI reminds of edge cases, human catches most
Month 3: Human designs async patterns fluently, AI rarely needed
\`\`\`

If dependency increases over time instead of decreasing, the design has failed.

## How to Know It's Working

Positive signals:
- "I would approach this differently now than a month ago"
- "I caught an error in AI output I wouldn't have noticed before"
- "I understand why this works, not just that it works"
- Spending more time on harder problems than before

Warning signals:
- "I don't know how I'd do this without AI"
- "I trust the output without checking"
- "I feel less confident in my judgment than before"
- Difficulty working unassisted for short periods

The goal is compounding capability, not compounding dependency.

---

These aren't expensive. Generation-Then-Comprehension requires asking questions. Job Crafting requires intentional task allocation. Mastery Orientation requires framing. Periodic practice requires calendar blocks. Metacognitive checkpoints require prompts.

The problem is real. The solutions are also real. AI that explains its reasoning maintains critical thinking. AI that invites questions builds understanding. AI that surfaces uncertainty preserves verification. AI that frames interactions as learning produces 35 times better outcomes than AI optimized for task completion.

Same technology, different design, opposite trajectory.

`,Qc=`# The Problem

The same tools that help you ship faster today are quietly making you less capable tomorrow.

---

## The Developer's Dilemma

You're debugging a React component. State updates aren't triggering re-renders. You could trace through the lifecycle, check dependency arrays, reason about closure capture—or you could ask Claude.

Claude gives you the answer. It's correct. You ship it. The feature works.

What changed?

Your codebase improved. Your deadline was met. But your ability to debug React components? That stayed exactly where it was. Maybe it slipped backward a little. You'll never know—there's no measurement for capability you didn't practice.

Now multiply this by every debugging session, every API design, every refactoring decision. Not once or twice, but fifty times a week for six months. The code keeps shipping. Your perceived productivity feels higher than ever. But something underneath is shifting.

This is the hollowing effect.

## Two Different Things

Productivity and capability are not the same thing.

**Productivity** is tasks completed per unit time. It's measurable, immediate, and legible. When AI autocompletes your function, you ship faster. [Research confirms this](../reference/productivity-evidence): 26% more tasks completed with AI assistance. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="RCTs, n=4,867">●</span>

**Capability** is what you can do without the tool. It's your baseline competence—the skills, patterns, and judgment you've internalized through practice. Capability is what remains when the AI is unavailable, when it hallucinates, when it suggests plausible-but-wrong solutions.

Here's the paradox: AI reliably increases productivity while simultaneously degrading capability. [Same populations measured different ways](../reference/skill-formation-evidence): perform 26% better with AI, score 17% worse on unassisted assessments three months later. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="RCT, n=1,000, PNAS">●</span>

Both effects are real. Both are measured. The question is not whether this tradeoff exists—it's whether we can design AI tools that break it.

## Why It Happens

The work hasn't disappeared. It's transformed.

Without AI, you generate solutions from first principles. You think through edge cases. You debug by reasoning about system behavior. This is cognitively expensive, but it's also practice. Each time you do it, the neural pathways strengthen.

With AI, you shift from generation to verification. You read mostly-correct code instead of writing it from scratch. You evaluate suggestions instead of creating them. This feels easier because generation was hard and visible. But verification introduces its own cognitive load—catching subtle errors in plausible output demands sustained attention you may not have developed.

The shift matters because **what you practice is what you get good at**. If you practice generating solutions, you become better at generation. If you practice reviewing AI output, you become better at reviewing—but only if you have the baseline competence to recognize errors.

Research on [cognitive offloading](../reference/cognitive-effects-evidence) shows the mechanism: when AI handles the thinking, humans stop encoding the information. <span class="ev ev-weak" title="Kosmyna et al. 2025, arXiv preprint, n=54">○</span> Participants in one study couldn't recall content from essays they'd written with AI assistance. They didn't forget—they never learned it in the first place.

## The Invisible Slide

Skill atrophy is hard to detect from the inside.

Medical research provides the clearest evidence: after AI-assisted colonoscopy was introduced at four centres, endoscopists' unaided detection rate declined 20% on their non-AI cases. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Budzyń et al. Lancet 2025, multicentre observational, 19 endoscopists">◐</span> The practitioners didn't notice. They felt equally competent. But measurable performance had degraded.

No equivalent study exists yet for software developers—the technology is too new. But the cognitive mechanisms are identical. Skills require practice. Remove the practice, lose the skill. The only question is how quickly.

The perception gap compounds the problem. Experienced developers in one study predicted AI would make them 24% faster; measurements showed they were 19% slower—a 43-point discrepancy between perception and reality. You can't fix degradation you don't perceive.

## The Trust Trap

AI's confidence makes calibration harder.

When AI explains its reasoning, people accept suggestions more readily—regardless of whether those suggestions are correct. This is measured: explanations increase acceptance for both correct and incorrect advice. When the advice is right, this helps slightly. When it's wrong, performance degrades.

The result is overreliance. [Trust without verification](../reference/cognitive-effects-evidence). Confidence in AI correlates negatively with critical thinking (β = -0.69). <span class="ev ev-strong" title="CHI peer-reviewed, n=319">●</span> The more you trust, the less you check. The less you check, the more errors slip through.

Meanwhile, usage rises even as trust falls. Developer survey data shows AI coding tool adoption increased from 76% to 84% while trust in AI accuracy dropped from 43% to 33%. People are using tools they don't trust, perceiving benefits measurements don't confirm.

This isn't irrational. It's structural. The work still needs shipping. The deadlines are still real. And the immediate productivity boost—even if smaller than perceived—is tangible. The capability loss is not.

## What This Means

The hollowing effect is not a bug. It's the predictable outcome of how human cognition interacts with capable AI systems.

When AI handles generation, humans lose practice in generation. When AI projects confidence, humans reduce verification. When productivity metrics improve, capability degradation becomes invisible. These mechanisms compound.

The outcome depends on design. Tools that answer questions directly harm learning. Tools that scaffold reasoning without removing agency preserve capability while adding value. The evidence for this is clear: GPT with hints caused no learning harm; GPT with direct answers caused 17% degradation—same technology, opposite outcomes.

This means the productivity-capability tradeoff is not inevitable. It's a consequence of how current AI tools are designed. Tools that substitute for human thinking create dependency. Tools that complement human thinking build capability.

The goal is not to reject AI. It's to design AI that makes humans more capable, not just more productive.

That's what collaborative intelligence means.
`,Xc=`# The Risks of Uncritical AI Adoption

What happens when we design AI tools without understanding how they affect human capability.

---

AI tools for software development promise productivity gains. Many deliver them—for a while. But beneath the immediate performance improvements, seven categories of risk compound silently. Each makes the others worse. Together, they create a dynamically unstable system where short-term gains mask long-term capability erosion.

This isn't speculation. Every risk has been measured. The question isn't whether these outcomes occur—it's whether your workflow prevents them.

## 1. Skill Atrophy

**The pattern:** Use AI assistance for three months, then remove it. Performance drops 20%. This isn't forgetting—it's neural pathway degradation from disuse. [cognitive effects evidence →](../reference/cognitive-effects-evidence) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Lancet RCT, medical domain">◐</span>

The mechanism is cognitive offloading. When AI handles reasoning, humans stop performing it. This is rational resource allocation—why think when AI does it faster? But cognition works like muscle: stop using it, lose it.

Not all skills atrophy equally. The most vulnerable are exactly those most valuable: reasoning about systems, analyzing edge cases, designing abstractions, recognizing code smells. Meanwhile typing speed and IDE shortcuts—procedural skills—remain intact. We're losing capability where it matters most.

The medical parallel is direct: after AI-assisted colonoscopy was introduced, endoscopists' unaided detection rate declined 20% on their non-AI cases (Budzyń et al. Lancet 2025, multicentre observational, 19 endoscopists). Software development involves more abstract reasoning than perceptual detection. The cognitive skills developers depend on may be even more vulnerable.

## 2. Security Degradation

**The pattern:** 45% of AI-generated code contains critical vulnerabilities—SQL injection, hardcoded credentials, insecure deserialization, missing validation. [productivity evidence →](../reference/productivity-evidence)

The mechanism is training data inheritance. AI models learn patterns from code repositories, including insecure ones. The model has no concept of "this pattern is insecure"—it knows only "this pattern is common." When Stack Overflow is training corpus and Stack Overflow contains vulnerable code, AI reproduces it faithfully.

The iteration paradox compounds this: common intuition suggests refinement improves security, but measurements show the opposite. Each iteration adds code without removing vulnerabilities from previous passes. Security degrades with effort.

Model size doesn't help. Better prompts don't eliminate vulnerability inheritance. The only reliable countermeasure is independent security review—which requires the security expertise that AI is actively eroding through skill offloading.

## 3. Code Quality Erosion

**The pattern:** Code duplication increases 8x after AI adoption. Refactoring plummets. Copy-paste patterns surge. The codebase shifts from architected to assembled. [productivity evidence →](../reference/productivity-evidence)

The mechanism: AI generates fresh solutions without awareness of existing patterns. Each generation produces plausible code that works in isolation but duplicates what already exists. The human who would have searched for reusable components instead gets a new implementation—faster to accept than to find and refactor.

The explainability gap opens wider each sprint. Developer writes 500 lines, understands all. AI generates 2,000 lines, developer understands 60%. Next iteration builds on that 60%, understanding drops to 30%. By sprint N, the codebase is assembled from components the developer never designed and doesn't fully comprehend.

Debugging becomes archaeological work. Maintenance becomes guesswork. Architecture evolution becomes impossible.

## 4. The Perception Gap

**The pattern:** Experienced developers predicted AI would make them 24% faster. Rigorous measurement showed they were 19% slower—a 43-point miscalibration between perception and reality. [productivity evidence →](../reference/productivity-evidence) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="METR RCT, n=16">◐</span>

Time spent prompting, reviewing, fixing, integrating—all uncounted in subjective assessment. The effort feels lighter because generation (visible work) disappears and verification (invisible work) appears. The task completes. The illusion persists.

The trust-behavior divergence amplifies the problem: trust in AI coding accuracy dropped from 43% to 33% in one year, yet adoption rose from 76% to 84%. People use tools they don't trust, perceive benefits contradicted by measurement, and make decisions based on false premises.

You can't fix what you can't see. Managers allocate timelines assuming productivity gains that don't exist. Developers underinvest in verification because the work feels complete. Teams ship faster while quality degrades. The perception gap prevents correction at every level.

## 5. Automation Complacency

**The pattern:** Confidence in AI negatively predicts critical thinking at β = -0.69. The more you trust AI, the less you verify it. The less you verify, the more errors propagate. [collaboration design evidence →](../reference/collaboration-design-evidence) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Lee et al. CHI 2025, n=319">●</span>

The mechanism is automation bias: repeated experience of AI being correct reduces vigilance. This manifests in verification latency—the time between receiving AI output and meaningful review. Immediate acceptance signals rubber-stamping. Genuine review takes minutes.

Explanations make it worse. When AI provides reasoning alongside answers, acceptance increases regardless of correctness. The explanation creates false confidence. Human evaluation collapses. [collaboration design evidence →](../reference/collaboration-design-evidence)

Developers spend only 22.4% of coding time verifying AI suggestions. Most can't report their own correction rate. The problem becomes invisible precisely when it matters most.

## 6. Homogenization

**The pattern:** AI-assisted outputs show 0.863 standard deviations less diversity than human-only outputs. This isn't small—it's structural convergence toward training data patterns. [homogenization evidence →](../reference/homogenization-evidence)

The mechanism: models share training data, converge to shared patterns, produce homogenized outputs regardless of sampling method. Temperature scaling doesn't help. Ensembling doesn't help. When everyone uses the same AI generating the same solutions, variety collapses.

Why homogenization matters: diverse groups outperform best-ability homogeneous groups for complex problem-solving. Different perspectives catch different errors, explore different solutions, prevent groupthink failure modes. Diversity isn't fairness theater—it's functional necessity.

Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety: a system can only regulate variety in its environment if it has equal or greater internal variety. When AI reduces solution diversity, the system loses the variety needed to handle unexpected problems. Fragility increases invisibly until the shock that reveals it.

## 7. Novice Vulnerability

**The pattern:** Students with unrestricted ChatGPT access scored 17% worse on exams without AI. Students with hint-only AI showed no degradation. Same technology, different interaction pattern, opposite outcomes. [skill formation evidence →](../reference/skill-formation-evidence)

The mechanism: direct answers bypass desirable difficulties—the productive struggle that builds understanding. Errors force diagnosis. Diagnosis builds mental models. Remove errors, remove learning.

Novices lack the foundational schema needed to evaluate AI output. An expert sees generated code and recognizes patterns, evaluates tradeoffs, spots subtle issues. A novice sees generated code that runs and assumes correctness.

A novice who learns to program with AI may never develop mental models of program execution, debugging intuition, design reasoning, or error recognition patterns. These aren't taught—they're built through struggle. Receiving solutions feels like learning but produces no schema formation.

## The Compounding Problem

These seven risks don't exist in isolation. They compound:

- Skill atrophy → reduced ability to catch security issues → vulnerabilities propagate
- Perception gap → under-investment in verification → automation complacency → more errors
- Code quality erosion → harder to debug → more reliance on AI → faster skill atrophy
- Homogenization → less diverse solutions → fragility → shocks the system can't absorb
- Novice vulnerability → no foundational schema → permanent capability gap → dependency

Each risk makes the others worse. The system is dynamically unstable.

The perception gap prevents correction. You can't fix degradation you can't see. Teams optimize for perceived productivity while actual capability erodes. By the time the problem becomes visible, the skills needed to address it have atrophied.

## When Risk Is Acceptable

Not all AI use produces these outcomes. The determining factor is complementary versus substitutive design. [collaboration design evidence →](../reference/collaboration-design-evidence)

| Pattern | Human Role | Outcome |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Substitutive** | Approves AI work | Atrophy |
| **Complementary** | Steers AI, retains reasoning | Capability maintained |

Complementary patterns that preserve capability:

- AI handles boilerplate, human handles architecture
- AI generates options, human evaluates and decides
- AI provides perspective, human synthesizes across multiple viewpoints
- AI explains reasoning, human evaluates logic chains

The distinction: who does the thinking? If AI thinks and human approves, capability erodes. If human thinks and AI amplifies, capability compounds.

## What We Don't Know

No longitudinal study tracks developer capability over 2-5 years of heavy AI use. We have three-month medical studies showing 20% skill loss. We have cross-sectional developer data showing perception gaps and reduced critical thinking. But the multi-year trajectory remains unknown.

Whether cognitive skills atrophy faster than motor skills is speculative. Whether early-career AI exposure prevents schema formation permanently is unknown. Whether complementary design actually prevents long-term atrophy is plausible but unproven beyond 12 weeks.

The research we need: cohort study, multiple interaction patterns, capability assessment at 6/12/24 months, measuring both assisted and unassisted performance. Until that exists, we're making trillion-dollar bets on inferences from short-term studies.

## The Design Imperative

The risks are real, measured, and structural. They're not eliminated by better models or clearer prompts. They require design interventions:

**Preserve the generative step.** In learning contexts, attempt first before consulting AI. Struggle builds schema.

**Inject metacognitive friction.** Planning, monitoring, evaluation checkpoints at decision points. Single-point friction is insufficient.

**Calibrate trust signals.** Don't project false certainty. Show uncertainty. Invite verification.

**Maintain variety.** Multiple perspectives, human synthesis, preserved diversity. Don't standardize on single AI.

**Measure what matters.** Correction rate, verification latency, independent capability checks. Perception is unreliable.

**Protect novices.** Hint-only mode for learning. Direct answers prevent schema formation.

## Understanding the Stakes

The question isn't whether AI tools improve immediate task performance—they do. The question is whether that improvement comes at the cost of the cognitive foundations that enable long-term capability.

Seven risk categories, all measured. All compounding. The system is dynamically unstable without intentional design.

The choice isn't whether to use AI. The choice is whether we design collaboration that maintains human capability or surrenders it.

`,$c=`# What is Collaborative Intelligence?

AI that amplifies human capability rather than replaces it.

---

## A Tale of Two Tutors

Imagine 1,000 students learning physics. Half receive GPT Base — it answers questions directly. Half receive GPT Tutor — it provides hints and asks guiding questions. Same underlying model. Same content domain. Different interaction design.

After working with their AI tools, all students take an assessment without AI assistance.

GPT Tutor students perform identically to those who never used AI. GPT Base students score **17% worse**. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="RCT, n=1,000, PNAS">●</span>

Same technology. One design preserved learning; the other damaged it.

This is the collaborative intelligence thesis in one study: the difference between AI that amplifies and AI that replaces is measurable, structural, and a matter of design choice.

## The Core Distinction

Collaborative Intelligence means AI systems designed to **amplify human capability and judgment** rather than substitute for them.

The distinction shows up in how humans interact with AI:

| Substitutive AI | Collaborative AI |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "Here's the answer" | "Here's how to think about this" |
| AI does the work, human approves | AI amplifies, human remains central |
| Trust becomes binary (accept/reject) | Trust becomes informed evaluation |
| Skills erode from disuse | Skills strengthen through practice |

This isn't about using AI less. It's about using it differently.

## The Interaction Pattern That Works

Anthropic researchers measured how different interaction patterns affect skill formation. They tested six approaches with 52 participants learning to code. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="RCT, n=52, Anthropic 2026">◐</span>

The **highest-performing pattern** (86% mastery) had AI generate code while the human actively comprehended through questioning. Not "human writes all code" (65%). Not "AI does everything" (39%). Active collaboration where generation is fast but understanding is preserved.

The failure mode wasn't AI generation. It was disengagement.

Users who passively accepted AI output scored 39%. Users who iteratively debugged without understanding scored 24%. The 86% mastery group learned more than the no-AI control while completing tasks faster.

This is what complementary design enables: **speed without capability loss**.

[Skill formation evidence →](../reference/skill-formation-evidence)

## The Strongest Levers

What predicts successful human-AI collaboration? Experiments with 654 professionals identified the key factors. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Blaurock et al. 2025, scenario experiments, n=654">◐</span>

| Lever | Effect Size | What It Means |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Control | β = 0.507 | User agency — the ability to direct, override, shape |
| Transparency | β = 0.415 | Understanding how AI reached conclusions |
| Task Complexity | β = 0.247 | AI helps more on complex tasks |
| Perceived Competence | β = 0.227 | User confidence in evaluation ability |

**Control and transparency dominate.** Not AI capability. Not speed. Whether the human can direct the collaboration and understand its reasoning.

Complementary design optimizes these levers. Control preserves human agency — the collaboration responds to human intent, not autonomous optimization. Transparency enables informed trust — the human evaluates reasoning, not just outcomes.

Substitutive design optimizes neither. Autonomous AI removes control. Black-box outputs eliminate transparency.

[Collaboration design evidence →](../reference/collaboration-design-evidence)

## The Gestalt Principle

Kurt Koffka wrote: "The whole is other than the sum of its parts."

Not "greater than" — **other than**. A melody isn't "better" than individual notes; it's a different kind of thing with properties its parts don't possess.

Collaborative Intelligence works the same way:

- **Humans** bring context, judgment, values, the ability to know when formal rules should bend
- **AI** brings computation, pattern recognition across vast data, speed, consistency
- **Collaboration** enables rapid iteration on ideas the human couldn't test alone, informed by experience AI couldn't replicate

The output is other than what either produces independently. A designer can't test a thousand variations in an afternoon. An AI can't judge which variation solves the actual human problem. Neither is "helping" the other. Both are necessary.

## The Mastery Frame

The largest effect size in the collaborative AI literature comes from how users frame their interactions.

Users focused on **mastery** (learning, understanding, growth) maintained critical thinking at **35.7x the odds** of users focused on **performance** (output, speed, task completion).

This isn't about working harder. It's about mental framing:

\`\`\`
Performance: "Get this done fast."
Mastery: "What can I learn from this?"

Performance: "Did it work?"
Mastery: "Why did it work?"

Performance: "Ship and move on."
Mastery: "What's the transferable principle?"
\`\`\`

Same work. Different frame. Order-of-magnitude difference in capability preservation.

Collaborative Intelligence operationalizes mastery orientation through design. Every interaction should be a learning moment. Show reasoning, not just results. Build transferable understanding, not one-time solutions.

[Cognitive effects evidence →](../reference/cognitive-effects-evidence)

## The Diversity Problem

W. Ross Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety: systems need internal diversity that matches environmental complexity to remain viable. A thermostat with one setting cannot regulate a room with varying heat sources.

When humans delegate thinking to AI without maintaining independent capability, collective variety decreases. Same training data, same architectures, same optimization targets produce similar reasoning patterns. Everyone asks the same oracle, receives similar answers, converges on similar approaches.

This matters because diverse groups outperform homogeneous groups of higher-ability individuals on complex problems. The mechanism: diverse heuristics prevent collective local maxima.

One study measured it directly. AI assistance increased individual novelty by 8% while increasing pairwise similarity by 10.7%. Everyone became individually more creative while collectively more similar. **Requisite variety decreased.**

Collaborative Intelligence preserves variety. Human judgment remains active. Different humans apply AI differently, question differently, synthesize differently. The collaboration amplifies without homogenizing.

## What This Means for Design

If Collaborative Intelligence is the goal, design follows:

**Human-Initiated Control** — Extensions respond to human direction, not autonomous optimization. The human sets goals, evaluates trade-offs, decides when to act. AI provides perspective; human integrates.

**Transparent Reasoning** — Show the chain: observation → analysis → recommendation. Explain why, not just what. The human can evaluate reasoning, not just accept or reject conclusions.

**Teach Frameworks, Not Answers** — Explain how to think about a problem, not just how to solve this instance. Transferable understanding compounds; one-time solutions don't.

**Composable Perspectives** — Small, focused tools that combine. Security + observability + performance → human synthesizes. Not one comprehensive agent that handles everything opaquely.

**Scaffold, Don't Substitute** — Temporary support that builds capability, not permanent crutches that create dependency. The collaboration should make you more capable tomorrow than today.

## Success Signals

How to know if collaboration is working:

**Positive signals:**
- "I would approach this differently now than a month ago"
- "I caught an error I wouldn't have noticed before"
- "I understand why this works, not just that it works"
- Handling harder problems than before

**Warning signals:**
- "I don't know how I'd do this without AI"
- "I trust the output without checking"
- "I feel less confident in my judgment"
- Difficulty working unassisted for short periods

The goal is compounding capability, not compounding dependency.

---

## The Thesis

AI reliably improves immediate task performance while degrading long-term human capability — unless designed not to.

The difference is measurable. Control, transparency, mastery orientation, engagement over delegation. These aren't marginal factors. They're structural.

Collaborative Intelligence isn't a technology choice. It's a design philosophy. Same models, different interaction patterns, opposite trajectories.

Design determines which.
`,Jc=`# Why It Matters

The patterns you establish now compound. Interest works both ways.

---

## The Compounding Metaphor

Imagine a savings account that runs in reverse when you make the wrong deposits. Every dollar you put in using the right approach grows at compound interest. Every dollar deposited the wrong way loses value — and the loss itself compounds, making the next loss larger.

AI collaboration works this way. The same tool, used with different patterns, produces opposite trajectories. One builds capability that makes the next interaction more productive. The other erodes capability in ways that accelerate over time.

This isn't speculation. It's measurable across multiple domains. The research shows both directions clearly.

## Negative Compounding: The Erosion Spiral

Start with confidence. When you trust AI output, you spend less time verifying it. Lee et al. measured this precisely: AI-confidence showed β = -0.69 correlation with critical thinking. <span class="ev ev-strong" title="CHI peer-reviewed, n=319, structural equation modeling">●</span> The more you trust the tool, the less you engage the cognitive processes that catch errors.

Less verification means fewer errors discovered. Fewer errors means the perception that AI is reliable. That perception increases confidence. Confidence reduces verification further. The cycle reinforces itself.

Meanwhile, skills atrophy from disuse. After AI-assisted colonoscopy was introduced at four centres, endoscopists' unaided detection rate declined from 28.4% to 22.4% on their non-AI cases — a 20% relative decline. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Budzyń et al. Lancet 2025, multicentre observational, 19 endoscopists">◐</span> The skills weren't practiced, so they degraded.

Degraded skills make AI feel more essential. If you struggle without the tool, you reach for it more often. More use means less practice. Less practice means further degradation. Another compounding cycle.

Zhou et al. documented what they called the "creative scar" — creativity dropped remarkably when AI was withdrawn, and the deficit persisted months later. Not just a temporary adjustment. A trajectory that continued downward even after AI removal. Each cycle of offloading made independent work harder, which made offloading more appealing, which made the next cycle worse.

This is negative compounding. Each effect feeds the next. The baseline shifts. What felt like augmentation becomes dependence.

## Positive Compounding: The Mastery Spiral

Now consider the opposite pattern. Shen & Tamkin studied 52 engineers learning a new Python library. Among those given AI access, six distinct interaction patterns emerged. The mastery scores ranged from 24% to 86% — from the same tool, in the same timeframe.

The highest performers used what researchers called "Generation-Then-Comprehension." The AI generated code. Then the human asked follow-up questions to understand how it worked. Each cycle built understanding that informed the next cycle. The AI provided speed. The human ensured learning. Final mastery: 86%.

The pattern creates positive compounding. Understanding from one interaction makes the next interaction more informed. Better questions produce better answers. Better answers deepen understanding. Understanding enables verification. Verification catches errors that would otherwise propagate. Each cycle strengthens the foundation for the next.

Pallant et al. found the strongest effect in the collaborative AI literature. Users with mastery orientation — those who framed interactions as learning opportunities rather than task completion — maintained critical thinking at 35.7 times the odds of performance-oriented users. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Single study, odds ratio">◐</span> The framing alone changed the trajectory.

Freise et al. studied job crafting patterns — how people allocate tasks between themselves and AI. Two patterns emerged. "Approach crafting" assigned AI to mundane work while reserving hard problems for the human. Result: the human practiced difficult skills more often, and those skills compounded. "Avoidance crafting" used AI to skip cognitively demanding tasks. Result: the human stopped practicing what mattered most, and capability eroded.

Same technology. Different allocation. Opposite compounding.

## Why the Same Tool Produces Opposite Outcomes

The tool doesn't determine the trajectory. The interaction pattern does.

Bastani et al. ran a randomized trial with 1,000 mathematics students. Two versions of ChatGPT — same underlying model, different interaction design. GPT Tutor provided hints only. GPT Base provided direct answers. The tutor version caused no harm to learning. The base version caused 17% worse performance on unassisted exams.

The mechanism: direct answers bypass the generative struggle where learning happens. Hints preserve that struggle while reducing friction. The difference isn't AI capability. It's whether the tool substitutes for thinking or supports it.

This explains why the Shen & Tamkin study found such wide mastery variation. AI Delegation users — those who pasted AI code and moved on — scored 39% mastery. They finished fastest (19.5 minutes average). Generation-Then-Comprehension users scored 86% mastery and finished only slightly slower (24 minutes). The speed-learning tradeoff was minimal. The pattern was everything.

## The Systemic Stakes

Individual trajectories matter. Collective trajectories matter more.

When everyone uses similar AI trained on similar data, outputs converge. Jiang et al. tested 70 language models on 26,000 open-ended queries. When asked for "a metaphor about time," outputs clustered into just two dominant patterns — regardless of model architecture, temperature settings, or provider. The convergence happened during training, not generation.

A meta-analysis of 28 studies covering 8,214 participants found individual creative performance increased by 0.27 standard deviations while collective diversity decreased by 0.863 standard deviations. Everyone got individually better. Everyone became collectively the same.

Hong & Page proved formally that randomly selected diverse groups outperform best-ability homogeneous groups on complex problems. The mechanism is mathematical: diverse perspectives search different regions of the solution space. Homogeneous groups, no matter how skilled, search the same regions repeatedly.

Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety states this as a cybernetic principle: a system must possess at least as much internal variety as the disturbances it encounters. When outputs converge while problems remain varied, the system loses capacity to handle complexity.

The stakes compound across scales. Individual dependency feeds organizational dependency. Teams converge on similar architectures because they consulted similar AI. Industries face similar blind spots because training data over-represents dominant patterns. The brittleness isn't visible until a novel problem arrives that doesn't match the convergent pattern.

## The Foundations Being Set Now

This is happening in 2025-2026, as AI becomes standard in software development. The junior engineers learning today will be the seniors teaching in five years. The interaction patterns becoming habitual now will propagate to the next cohort. The defaults being accepted will become institutional norms.

If those patterns are substitutive — accept output, skip understanding, optimize for speed — the capability erosion compounds across career arcs and across organizations. The perception gap means individuals won't notice. Kosmyna et al. measured brain activity during AI-assisted writing (arXiv preprint, n=54). Neural connectivity scaled down. Memory encoding regions showed reduced activation. 83% of participants couldn't recall quotes from their own AI-assisted essays. The work was done, but the learning never occurred. The participants didn't perceive the gap.

If the patterns are complementary — generate then comprehend, verify reasoning, reserve hard problems for practice — capability compounds in the opposite direction. Each interaction builds judgment. Judgment enables better verification. Verification catches errors that inform future decisions. The engineer in five years is more capable than the engineer today. The baseline rises.

The critical period is now because the foundations scale. Small differences in interaction patterns produce large differences in outcomes when compounded over thousands of hours and hundreds of engineers.

## What Determines the Direction

Control is the strongest lever. β = 0.507 from experiments with 654 professionals. When users shape AI direction rather than accepting outputs passively, capability is preserved. [Collaboration design evidence →](../reference/collaboration-design-evidence) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Blaurock et al. 2025, scenario experiments, n=654">◐</span>

Transparency is second. β = 0.415. When reasoning is visible, users can evaluate it. Evaluation maintains engagement. Engagement prevents cognitive offloading.

Mastery orientation dominates both. OR = 35.7. Framing the interaction as learning rather than task completion changes every downstream choice. Generation-Then-Comprehension vs AI Delegation. Approach Crafting vs Avoidance Crafting. Verification vs passive acceptance.

These aren't expensive to implement. They require intentionality. The question is whether the defaults encourage the right patterns.

## The Unsolved Question

No longitudinal study tracks developer capability over extended AI use. We have three-month medical studies showing 20% skill loss. We have 70-minute learning sessions showing 24-86% mastery variation. We have two-month creativity studies showing persistent "scars." But the five-year trajectory of a software engineer using AI daily remains unmeasured.

The inference is clear from adjacent domains and first principles. Positive compounding works. Negative compounding works. Both are self-reinforcing. The pattern established early determines the direction.

The foundations being set now — in onboarding, in code reviews, in institutional defaults — compound across careers and across organizations. Design determines whether five years from now, engineers are more capable than ever, or unable to function without tools they don't understand.

## The Confidence-Competence Inversion

### Lee et al. (CHI 2025) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="CHI peer-reviewed, n=319, structural equation modeling">●</span>

**Design:** Structural equation modeling with 319 knowledge workers.

**Key findings:**

| Confidence Type | Effect on Critical Thinking | Mechanism |
|----------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| AI-confidence (trust in AI) | β = -0.69 (strong negative) | "AI is reliable" triggers cognitive offloading |
| Self-confidence (trust in own judgment) | β = +0.35 (moderate positive) | "I can evaluate" maintains engagement |

The inversion is structural. Higher AI confidence reduces the perceived need for verification. Lower self-confidence reduces the belief that verification would help. Both suppress critical thinking through different mechanisms.

**The design paradox:** Making AI more accurate and trustworthy increases AI-confidence, which decreases critical thinking, which increases error propagation. Better AI can produce worse outcomes if human engagement collapses.

### PME Friction Intervention <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Same study, controlled experiment">●</span>

Lee et al. tested three-component metacognitive friction — Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation:

| Phase | Intervention | Effect |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Planning | "What's your approach before I assist?" | Preserves the generative step |
| Monitoring | "Does this match expectations?" | Maintains engagement during execution |
| Evaluation | "What would you change next time?" | Crystallizes learning |

Three-component friction significantly restored critical thinking that was otherwise suppressed by AI confidence. Single-point friction was insufficient — all three checkpoints were necessary.

**Limitations:** Cross-sectional design — no longitudinal tracking. β interpretation assumes causality in SEM but the data is observational.

---

## Neural Evidence for Cognitive Offloading

### Kosmyna et al. (MIT Media Lab, 2025) <span class="ev ev-weak" title="Kosmyna et al. 2025, arXiv preprint, n=54, published critique">○</span>

**Design:** Between-subjects EEG study, n=54 (18 per group: LLM, Search Engine, Brain-only). arXiv preprint ([2506.08872](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872)), NOT peer-reviewed.

**Key findings:**
- Neural connectivity "systematically scaled down" during AI-assisted writing (up to 55% reduced vs brain-only)
- Reduced activation in memory encoding regions
- Lower engagement in executive function networks
- Decreased integration between sensory input and long-term storage
- 83% of LLM group couldn't recall quotes from their own AI-assisted essays (Session 1)
- Session 4 crossover: 78% of former-LLM users still couldn't quote without AI

The brain treated AI-assisted writing differently from unassisted writing at a physiological level. Information was processed, formatted, submitted — but never encoded as learned knowledge.

**Limitations:** Small sample (n=54, 18 per group). Not peer-reviewed. Published methodological critique (Stankovic et al., arXiv:2601.00856) identifies concerns with study design, reproducibility, EEG methodology. Authors state conclusions should be "treated with caution and as preliminary." Single writing domain.

---

## Cognitive Offloading Correlation

### Gerlich (2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Survey study, n=666, single source">◐</span>

**Design:** Survey of 666 participants measuring cognitive offloading and critical thinking.

**Key findings:**
- r = -0.75 correlation between cognitive offloading and critical thinking
- r = -0.68 correlation between AI use and critical thinking
- AI use negatively predicts critical thinking (β = -1.76)
- Younger users (18-25) showed stronger negative effects than older users (56-65)

**Age effect hypothesis:** Older users have established cognitive schemas that resist replacement. Younger users building initial schemas are more vulnerable to substitution. If correct, AI exposure during learning phases may have compounding effects — skills never acquired can't be recovered.

**Limitations:** Survey-based, self-report. Correlation not causation. Single source.

---

## Metacognition Without Learning

### Fernandes et al. (CHI 2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="CHI peer-reviewed, single study">◐</span>

**Key finding:** "Smarter but none the wiser" — AI users showed improved task performance without improved metacognitive awareness. Performance metrics went up. Metacognitive calibration stayed flat.

**Mechanism:** AI bypasses desirable difficulties — the productive struggle that builds understanding. Errors force diagnosis. Diagnosis builds mental models. Remove errors, remove learning.

**Limitations:** Single study. Mechanism inferred from results.

---

## The Inversion Scenario

### Lee, D. et al. (PNAS Nexus 2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="PNAS Nexus, theoretical model with empirical support">◐</span>

**Key finding:** A skeptical user with mediocre AI outperforms a credulous user with state-of-the-art AI.

| User Type | AI Quality | Outcome |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| High metacognitive sensitivity (skeptical) | Mediocre | Catches errors, verifies claims, learns — robust outcomes |
| Low metacognitive sensitivity (credulous) | State-of-the-art | Accepts outputs uncritically — fragile outcomes |

Human metacognitive sensitivity matters more than model accuracy. The marginal return to model accuracy diminishes as human engagement drops. Past a threshold, improving the AI makes outcomes worse by suppressing metacognitive processes that catch edge cases.

**Limitations:** Theoretical model with limited empirical validation. The exact threshold is unknown.

---

## The Cognitive Mirror

### Tomisu et al. (Frontiers in Education, 2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Frontiers in Education, single study">◐</span>

**Technique:** Reflecting the human's reasoning back with structured questions rather than providing answers.

The pattern forces articulation (makes implicit explicit) → evaluation (metacognitive monitoring) → gap discovery (generative learning). Instead of "here's the solution," the interaction becomes "here's what I see in your reasoning — what am I missing?"

**Mechanism:** Making implicit reasoning explicit activates metacognitive monitoring. Humans notice flaws in their own logic when forced to explain it. AI-generated solutions bypass this entirely.

**Limitations:** Qualitative study. Effect size not quantified.

---

## The CAIM Framework

Multiple studies converged on the Collaborative AI Metacognition (CAIM) scale measuring four dimensions:

| Dimension | Definition | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Understanding | Knowing AI capabilities and limits | Calibrates expectations |
| Use | Choosing when to engage AI | Prevents inappropriate delegation |
| Evaluation | Assessing output quality | Error detection |
| Ethics | Recognizing implications | Long-term judgment |

Traditional AI design optimizes for Use — making the tool easy to invoke. But Understanding, Evaluation, and Ethics are what prevent cognitive collapse.

## The Unsolved Question

No longitudinal study tracks developer capability decline over extended AI use. We have 3-month medical studies showing 20% skill loss ([skill formation evidence →](skill-formation-evidence)). We have cross-sectional developer data showing perception gaps and reduced critical thinking. But the multi-year trajectory remains unknown.

The research we need: cohort study tracking developers' unassisted capability over 2-5 years of varied AI use. Until that exists, we're inferring from adjacent domains and short-term experiments.

## The Strongest Levers

### Blaurock et al. (2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Scenario experiments, n=654, J. Service Research">◐</span>

**Design:** Two scenario-based experiments with 654 professionals (309 financial services + 345 HR).

**Key findings:**

| Factor | Effect Size | What It Means |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Process control | **β = 0.507** | User agency — ability to direct, override, shape collaboration |
| Transparency | **β = 0.415** | Understanding how AI reached conclusions |
| Task complexity | β = 0.247 | AI helps more on complex tasks |
| Perceived competence | β = 0.227 | User confidence in their ability to evaluate |
| Engagement features | **b = -0.555** | Each added feature *reduces* trust |

**Control and transparency dominate.** Not AI capability. Not speed. Whether the human can direct the collaboration and understand its reasoning.

**The engagement paradox:** Adding engagement features — gamification, personalization, social elements — reduces trust (b = -0.555). Each feature added for "better user experience" measurably degrades the collaboration. Users want control and understanding, not friction disguised as interaction.

**Limitations:** Scenario-based experiments, not field study. Effect sizes from full text not independently verified from public sources. Service context (financial services, HR), not software development specifically.

---

## Why Explanations Backfire

### Bansal et al. (CHI 2021) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="CHI peer-reviewed, controlled experiment">●</span>

**Design:** Controlled experiment comparing AI with and without explanations, across correct and incorrect AI outputs.

**Key finding:** Explanations increase acceptance regardless of correctness.

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Correct AI + explanation | Small improvement in outcomes |
| Incorrect AI + explanation | **Performance degraded** |

When AI is right, explanations help slightly. When AI is wrong, explanations build false confidence and suppress verification. The explanation creates trust without calibrating it.

**Implication:** Transparency alone is insufficient. Explanations must be paired with verification prompts, or they become persuasion tools rather than calibration tools.

---

## Contrastive Explanations

### Ma et al. (2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Taylor & Francis, controlled study">◐</span>

**Key finding:** Framing shifts change how humans process AI recommendations.

| Framing | Example | Cognitive Mode |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Prescriptive | "Use Redis for this cache." | Heuristic acceptance |
| Contrastive | "Redis instead of Memcached because you need data structures beyond key-value." | Analytic evaluation |

**Mechanism:**
- Shows alternatives were considered
- Makes tradeoffs visible
- Activates comparison rather than acceptance
- Teaches decision frameworks, not just decisions

Prescription invites blind trust. Contrast invites evaluation.

**Limitations:** Single study. Effect size not fully quantified.

---

## The WHY > HOW Principle

A security study compared two approaches to teaching developers:

| Approach | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Prescribe HOW ("Always use prepared statements") | 30% secure-by-construction |
| Explain WHY ("SQL injection occurs when user input is treated as code...") | **80%** secure-by-construction |

**2.5x improvement** from explaining motivation rather than mandating method. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Single study, security coding domain">◐</span>

**Mechanism:** HOW prescriptions create brittle rules applied in narrow contexts. WHY explanations build transferable frameworks that generalize.

---

## The Senior-Junior Gap

### Stack Overflow (2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Stack Overflow survey, large N, observational">◐</span>

| Behavior | Seniors | Juniors |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Trust AI output | 2.5% | 17% |
| Ship AI code to production | 32% | 13% |
| Edit AI suggestions | Substantial | Minor or none |

**The paradox:** Seniors trust AI least but ship most AI code. They treat AI output as a first draft from a junior developer — read carefully, check edge cases, verify against production constraints, refactor for codebase patterns.

Juniors trust more and ship less because they lack judgment to evaluate.

**Design implication:** Systems optimized for seniors (who verify regardless) fail juniors (who need scaffolding for verification).

---

## Users Misjudge What Helps Them

### Sharma et al. (Anthropic, 2026) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Large-scale observational study, ~1.5M conversations, single platform">◐</span>

**Design:** Analysis of ~1.5 million Claude.ai conversations.

**Key finding:** Users rate disempowering interactions MORE favorably in the moment. Interactions that distorted reality, value judgments, or actions felt good.

But when users actually acted on AI outputs, satisfaction dropped below baseline. Users expressed regret: "I should have listened to my own intuition."

**Implication:** Short-term satisfaction ≠ long-term benefit. The feedback loop is broken — harm feels helpful. Design must compensate for miscalibrated user preferences.

---

## Trust Gradients

Not all outputs need the same verification depth:

| Output Type | Trust | Verification |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Formatting, syntax | High | Glance |
| Library usage, API calls | Medium | Check docs for edge cases |
| Business logic | Low | Full review against requirements |
| Security-sensitive code | Very low | Dedicated security review |
| Architecture decisions | Very low | Multiple perspectives |

**Correction rate as calibration metric:**

| Rate | Signal |
|------|--------|
| &lt; 5% | Under-reviewing — automation bias risk |
| 10-30% | Healthy calibration |
| &gt; 50% | AI not effective for this task |

---

## Verification Decay Pattern

Trust calibration degrades without maintenance:

\`\`\`
Day 1: Carefully review every suggestion
Day 7: Skim, spot-check occasionally
Day 30: Accept if it "looks right"
Day 90: Auto-accept until things break
\`\`\`

**Counter-patterns:**
- Structured verification checklist (&lt; 30 seconds, applied consistently)
- Spot audits (randomly deep-verify even when confident)
- Red team rotations (assume output is wrong, find the error)
- Track verification catch rate

## The Artificial Hivemind

### Jiang et al. (NeurIPS 2025 Best Paper) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="NeurIPS Best Paper, 70+ models, 26,000 queries">●</span>

**Design:** Testing 70+ language models on 26,000 open-ended queries.

**Key finding:** When 25 different models wrote "a metaphor about time," only 2 dominant response clusters emerged. Convergence appeared regardless of model architecture or temperature settings.

**Mechanism:** RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) optimizes for consensus — penalizing valid but idiosyncratic responses. Temperature and ensembling don't help. The convergence happens during training, not generation.

**Limitations:** Focused on creative/open-ended tasks. Convergence in structured tasks (code, math) may differ.

---

## Meta-Analysis: Diversity Reduction

### 28 Studies, n=8,214 <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Meta-analysis, 28 studies, n=8,214, p&lt;0.001">●</span>

**Key finding:** Pooled effect size for diversity reduction: **g = -0.863** (95% CI: -1.328 to -0.398, p&lt;0.001). Large negative effect by Cohen's standards — one of the largest observed in the creativity literature.

Individual creative performance increased (+0.27). Collective diversity collapsed (-0.863). Everyone becomes individually better. Everyone becomes collectively the same.

---

## The Social Dilemma

### Doshi & Hauser (Science Advances, 2024) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Science Advances peer-reviewed, controlled experiment">●</span>

**Key finding:** Individual novelty **+8.1%**, story similarity **+10.7%**.

Each person is individually better off using AI. Collectively, the diversity that enables innovation disappears. A classic social dilemma — individual rationality producing collective harm.

---

## Visual Convergence

### Hintze et al. (Patterns/Cell, 2026) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Single study, 700 trials, Patterns/Cell">◐</span>

**Design:** 700 iterative AI image generation loops with varied starting prompts.

**Key finding:** ALL converged to just 12 visual motifs — lighthouses, Gothic cathedrals, rustic buildings with warm lighting — regardless of starting prompt. Convergence occurred within 15-20 iterations.

> "What they generated is bland, pop culture, generic... visual elevator music."

Technically competent, individually pleasant, collectively indistinguishable.

---

## Cultural Erosion

### Agarwal et al. (CHI 2025) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="CHI peer-reviewed, classification study">●</span>

**Design:** Classifiers trained to distinguish cultural origin in writing.

**Key finding:** Cultural classification accuracy dropped from **90.6% to 83.5%** with AI assistance — a 7-point drop in cultural distinguishability.

Non-Western writers using AI sound more Western. Not because they intend to — because training data over-represents Western perspectives and RLHF reinforces dominant patterns. This isn't preference. It's erasure.

---

## Text Convergence

### Xu et al. (PNAS 2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="PNAS peer-reviewed, single study">◐</span>

**Key finding:** "Echoes" — idiosyncratic plot elements recurring across different LLMs with implausible frequency. Specific character names, plot devices, and narrative structures appear across models. Not plagiarism — convergent outputs from shared training distributions.

### Zhang et al. (Sociological Methods & Research, 2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Single study, social science domain">◐</span>

**Key finding:** Content overlap between different respondents: **67-75%** with AI assistance. Open-ended survey responses — supposedly the most personal form of data — became statistically similar.

**Methodological implication:** Social science relies on diverse perspectives. If AI assistance homogenizes responses, what are we actually measuring?

---

## Theoretical Foundations

### Why Diversity Matters: Hong & Page (2004) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="PNAS, formal mathematical proof + simulation">●</span>

Formal mathematical proof + simulation: **randomly selected diverse groups outperform best-ability homogeneous groups** on complex problem-solving tasks.

The mechanism is not about individual skill — it's about coverage of the solution space. Diverse perspectives explore different paths. Homogeneous groups search the same regions repeatedly. "Diversity trumps ability" in complex domains with large solution spaces.

### Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety (1956) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Formal cybernetic principle">●</span>

> "Only variety can absorb variety."

A control system must possess at least as much internal variety as the disturbances it encounters. When outputs converge while problems remain varied, the system loses its ability to cope.

---

## The Financial Analogy

**Haldane (Bank of England, 2009):** By 2008, hedge fund strategies showed average pairwise correlation of ~0.35. Everyone optimized for the same signals. When the market turned, strategies failed simultaneously. Correlation during crisis approached 1.0. <span class="ev ev-weak" title="Expert analysis, historical case study">○</span>

> "Finance has a natural tendency toward monoculture. And monoculture, in finance as in agriculture, creates vulnerability to catastrophic risk."

The parallel to AI is illustrative, not precise — software doesn't crash globally like markets. But the principle holds: shared vulnerabilities from shared patterns propagate simultaneously.

---

## Why the Mechanism Is Structural

AI doesn't cause homogenization through poor design. It's a natural consequence of how the technology works:

1. **Training on consensus.** Models learn "write something typical" not "write something distinctive."
2. **Anchoring effects.** AI suggestions shape final outputs even when modified.
3. **Iterative reinforcement.** AI-generated content in training data reinforces convergence (model collapse). Shumailov et al. (Nature, 2024) showed iterative training on model outputs leads to "irreversible defects" — diversity collapse worsening each generation.

---

## Mitigation Evidence

### Diverse Personas

**Wan & Kalman (2025):** 10 diverse AI "personas" eliminated the homogenization effect. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Single study, promising but needs replication">◐</span>

| Measure | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Within-persona similarity | 0.92 |
| Across-persona similarity | 0.20 |

Users exposed to multiple personas maintained diversity comparable to no-AI baseline. Diverse starting points prevent anchoring to a single mode.

### Divergent Thinking Prompts

Jiang et al. proposed explicitly instructing models to produce unusual responses. Early results suggest this helps but doesn't eliminate convergence — training distribution still constrains outputs. <span class="ev ev-weak" title="Proposed intervention, limited validation">○</span>

### Attempt-First

Generate before consulting AI. Prevents anchoring to AI mode.

### Source Diversity

Train on underrepresented data. Reduces Western bias (Agarwal). <span class="ev ev-strong" title="CHI peer-reviewed">●</span>

## The Perception Gap

### METR RCT (2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="RCT, n=16, within-subject design on own repos">◐</span>

**Design:** Within-subject RCT. 16 experienced open-source developers working in their own repositories on real tasks from their backlogs.

**Key findings:**

| Metric | Without AI | With AI | Gap |
|--------|-----------|---------|-----|
| Actual completion time | Baseline | **+19% slower** | -19% |
| Predicted completion time | Baseline | -24% faster | **+43 points** |
| Developer confidence | — | "AI made me faster" | Illusion |

The miscalibration is structural. Time spent prompting, reviewing suggestions, fixing integration issues, and context-switching doesn't register as "work." Code appearing on screen feels like productivity. The invisible effort of verification and correction disappears from perception.

**Why this study matters:** No toy problems, no unfamiliar domains, no confounding variables. Experienced developers in codebases they knew best. The most controlled productivity measurement available.

**Limitations:** n=16 — rigorous design but small sample. Experienced developers only (no juniors). Short-term tasks.

### Perception at Scale

Stack Overflow survey data confirms the trap:

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 | Direction |
|--------|------|------|-----------|
| AI adoption | 76% | 84% | Rising |
| Trust in AI accuracy | 43% | 33% | Falling |

Adoption rises while trust falls. People use tools they don't trust because perceived productivity overrides measured performance.

---

## Productivity Gains (Real)

### Cui/Demirer RCTs (2024) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Multiple RCTs, n=4,867">●</span>

**Design:** Multiple randomized controlled trials across high-skilled occupations. Total n=4,867.

**Key finding:** 26% more tasks completed with AI assistance.

The productivity gains are real and substantial. This isn't contested. The question is whether they come at the cost of capability development — and the evidence from [skill formation →](skill-formation-evidence) suggests the tradeoff is engagement-pattern-dependent.

### What Actually Improves

| Task Type | Evidence | Magnitude |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Boilerplate generation | Multiple studies | Significant time savings |
| Code translation | GitHub research | Meaningful improvement |
| API exploration | Microsoft research | Faster onboarding |
| Prototyping | Surveys + anecdotal | Widely reported |

Gains concentrate in generation-heavy tasks with low maintenance burden.

---

## Code Quality Degradation

### GitClear (2025) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Longitudinal analysis, 211M LOC across organizations">●</span>

**Design:** Analysis of 211 million lines of code across organizations before and after AI adoption.

**Key findings:**

| Metric | Before AI | After AI |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Code duplication rate | Baseline | **8x increase** |
| Refactoring commits | Baseline | **Sharp decline** |
| "Moved" and "Copy/paste" code | Baseline | **Significant increase** |

**Mechanism:** AI generates code without awareness of existing implementations. Each generation produces a fresh solution. The developer who would have searched for reusable components instead gets plausible new code — faster to accept than to find and integrate.

**The cathedral-to-prefabs shift:** Codebases transition from designed (developer architected) to assembled (connected generated components). Refactoring decline signals loss of abstraction skill.

### DORA Metrics (2024) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="Industry survey, large sample">●</span>

Industry-wide engineering effectiveness:

| Metric | Change with AI adoption |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Deployment stability | **-7.2%** |
| Throughput | **-1.5%** |

Not one company or team — the aggregate signal across the industry. AI adoption correlates with slight degradation in metrics that matter for software delivery performance.

---

## Security Degradation

### Baseline Vulnerability Rate

**Veracode (2025):** 45% of AI-generated code contains critical vulnerabilities. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Veracode static analysis report">◐</span> Basic patterns: hardcoded credentials, SQL injection via string concatenation, missing input validation, insecure deserialization.

### The Iteration Trap

**Shukla et al. (2025):** Security degrades with iteration, not improves. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Shukla et al. arXiv, systematic analysis">◐</span>

| Iteration | Vulnerabilities per 1000 LOC |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Initial generation | 2.1 |
| After refinement | **6.2** |

Each round adds code without removing vulnerabilities from previous rounds. The human reviewing iteration N has more to verify and less understanding of cumulative risk.

### Vulnerability Inheritance

**Perry et al. (2025):** Analysis of 7,703 files. AI inherits vulnerabilities from training data systematically. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Perry et al. arXiv, 7,703 file analysis">◐</span> When Stack Overflow is training corpus and Stack Overflow contains insecure patterns, AI reproduces them faithfully. The model has no concept of "this pattern is insecure" — only "this pattern is common."

Model size provides no protection. Larger models aren't more secure.

---

## The Explainability Gap

Code complexity increases while developer understanding decreases. A compounding pattern:

\`\`\`
Sprint 1: Developer writes 500 LOC, understands all of it
Sprint 2: AI generates 2000 LOC, developer understands ~60%
Sprint 3: AI generates atop Sprint 2, developer understands ~30%
Sprint N: Codebase assembled, not designed — comprehension lost
\`\`\`

Consequences:
- Can't debug what you don't understand
- Can't maintain what you can't reason about
- Can't secure code you haven't comprehended
- Can't evolve architecture you didn't design

The productivity gain in generation becomes productivity loss in maintenance.

## Six Interaction Patterns

### Shen & Tamkin (Anthropic, 2026) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="RCT, n=52, single library, 70-minute session">◐</span>

**Design:** Randomized controlled trial. 52 software engineers learning a new Python library (Trio async). AI group had Claude access. Control group had documentation only.

**Key finding:** Six distinct interaction patterns emerged from identical AI access, producing mastery scores from 24% to 86%.

| Pattern | Mastery | Behavior |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Generation-Then-Comprehension | 86% | AI generated code → human asked follow-up questions |
| Hybrid Code-Explanation | 68% | Requested explanations alongside code |
| Conceptual Inquiry | 65% | Conceptual questions only, wrote code themselves |
| AI Delegation | 39% | Paste and move on |
| Progressive Reliance | 35% | Started manual, ended delegating |
| Iterative Debugging | 24% | AI fixes errors repeatedly |

**The error mechanism:** Control group encountered median 3 errors during the learning task. AI users who delegated encountered 1 error. The errors — especially Trio-specific TypeError and RuntimeWarning — forced understanding of how the library actually worked. AI users who delegated never hit those errors. They finished faster and learned nothing.

**Participant self-awareness:** AI users recognized the gap:
- "I feel like I got lazy"
- "There are still a lot of gaps in my understanding"
- "I wish I'd taken the time to understand the explanations more"

**Speed vs learning tradeoff:** Fastest completion (AI Delegation, 19.5 min) produced worst learning (39%). Best learning (Generation-Then-Comprehension, 24 min) was only slightly slower while building actual capability.

**Experience-level differences:** Junior developers showed largest productivity gains (27-39%) and largest learning deficits. Seniors showed smaller gains (7-16%) but maintained capability.

**Limitations:** n=52. Single library (Trio async). 70-minute session — no measurement of long-term retention. Needs replication across different domains and timeframes.

---

## Scaffolded vs Direct AI

### Bastani et al. (PNAS, 2025) <span class="ev ev-strong" title="RCT, n=1,000, PNAS peer-reviewed">●</span>

**Design:** Randomized controlled trial with 1,000 students in mathematics education.

**Key finding:** Two versions of ChatGPT, same underlying model, opposite learning outcomes.

| Condition | Learning Outcome |
|-----------|-----------------|
| No AI (control) | Baseline |
| GPT Tutor (hints only) | No harm to learning |
| GPT Base (direct answers) | **17% worse** on unassisted assessment |

**Mechanism:** Direct answers bypass desirable difficulties — the productive struggle that builds understanding. Hints preserve the generative step where learning occurs.

**Implication:** Same technology, different interaction design, opposite trajectories. The variable is whether the tool substitutes for thinking or supports it.

**Limitations:** Mathematics education — transfer to software development is plausible but not directly measured. Single academic domain.

---

## Skill Atrophy Over Time

### Budzyń et al. (Lancet Gastroenterol. Hepatol., 2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Budzyń et al. 2025, multicentre observational, n=19 endoscopists, 4 centres">◐</span>

**Design:** Multicentre observational study (before/after). 19 experienced endoscopists across 4 centres in Poland. AI-assisted colonoscopy introduced end of 2021; non-AI colonoscopies compared before (n=795) vs after (n=648) regular AI exposure. Sept 2021 – March 2022.

**Key finding:** Adenoma detection rate on non-AI colonoscopies declined from 28.4% to 22.4% after AI exposure — a **20% relative decline** (6% absolute).

**Mechanism:** Perceptual skills require practice. Regular AI-assisted work reduces practice of unaided detection. The skill degraded without explicit AI removal — endoscopists simply performed worse on their non-AI cases.

**The Savings Effect:** Relearning takes less than 50% of original training time (established cognitive science finding). Skills are dormant, not destroyed.

**Limitations:** Observational design (not RCT) — confounders possible. Medical/perceptual domain — transfer to software development (cognitive/reasoning skills) is uncertain. No equivalent study exists for developers.

### Longitudinal Evidence

**Medical parallel:** After regular AI-assisted colonoscopy was introduced, endoscopists' unaided detection rate declined 20% on their non-AI cases. <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Budzyń et al. Lancet 2025, multicentre observational, 19 endoscopists">◐</span> Software development involves more abstract reasoning than perceptual skills — whether cognitive skills atrophy faster or slower is unknown. <span class="ev ev-speculative" title="Cross-domain inference">◌</span>

---

## The Creative Scar

### Zhou et al. (Technology in Society, 2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Longitudinal experiment, n=61, 2-month follow-up">◐</span>

**Design:** 7-day lab experiment with 2-month follow-up. 61 participants, 3,593 ideas generated.

**Key finding:** Creativity drops remarkably when AI is withdrawn, and homogeneity keeps climbing even months later. The "creative scar" persists.

> "Users do not truly acquire the ability to create but easily lose it once generative AI is no longer available."

This is the longitudinal evidence showing capability degradation persisting after AI removal — not just correlation, but measured trajectory over time.

**Limitations:** n=61. Creativity tasks, not software. 2-month follow-up may not capture full recovery timeline.

---

## Mastery vs Performance Orientation

### Pallant et al. (2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="Single study, odds ratio">◐</span>

**Key finding:** The largest effect size in the collaborative AI literature.

| Orientation | Critical Thinking Maintenance |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Mastery (focused on learning) | **OR = 35.7** |
| Performance (focused on output) | Baseline |

Users who framed AI interactions as learning opportunities maintained critical thinking at 35.7x the odds of users who framed interactions as task completion.

This dominates control (β = 0.507) and transparency (β = 0.415) from [collaboration design evidence →](collaboration-design-evidence).

**Limitations:** Single study. Odds ratio from observational data. Needs replication.

---

## Job Crafting Patterns

### Freise et al. (HICSS, 2025) <span class="ev ev-moderate" title="HICSS 2025, qualitative study">◐</span>

Two task allocation patterns produce opposite outcomes:

**Approach Crafting** — Assign AI to mundane work, reserve hard problems for yourself:
- AI handles: Boilerplate, CRUD, formatting, test scaffolding
- Human handles: Architecture, domain models, edge cases, design
- Result: Human practices hard skills more. Skills compound.

**Avoidance Crafting** — Use AI to avoid cognitively demanding tasks:
- AI handles: Complex algorithms, architecture, debugging
- Human handles: Review, simple implementations, routine changes
- Result: Human stops practicing skills that matter most. Capability erodes.

**The differentiator:** Not usage frequency. Not AI capability. What the human reserves for themselves.

**Limitations:** Qualitative study. Observational patterns, not controlled experiment.

---

## Recovery Protocols

Based on the atrophy evidence, three evidence-based recovery approaches:

**Switch-Off Protocol** — Periodic work without AI assistance:

| Frequency | Duration | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Weekly | 2-4 hours | Maintain baseline capability |
| Monthly | Full day | Test independent function |
| Quarterly | Complex task end-to-end | Deep capability assessment |

**Simulator Protocol** — Attempt-first before AI consultation. 15-30 minutes of independent effort preserves problem-solving practice while still leveraging AI. <span class="ev ev-speculative" title="Aviation training analogy + Bastani PNAS findings">◌</span>

**Hybrid Protocol** — Generation-Then-Comprehension as daily practice. AI generates, human comprehends through questioning. Speed preserved, understanding compounds.
