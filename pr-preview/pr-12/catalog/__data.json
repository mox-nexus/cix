A caching decision involves economics (cost), consistency (distributed systems), security (DoS vectors), and capacity (memory bounds). Most reviews miss something because they come from one viewpoint.\n\nThe Guild provides structured multi-perspective evaluation. Each agent has a defined domain and **orthogonality lock** — they can only discuss their area. This prevents homogenization and forces genuine perspective diversity.\n\n## When to Use\n\nThe Guild activates when you:\n\n- Review architecture for a service or system\n- Evaluate design decisions (caching, API protocol, boundaries)\n- Check production readiness\n- Make tradeoff decisions between competing concerns\n- Need to understand why legacy code exists before changing it\n\n**Example prompts:**\n- \"Review this architecture for a payment system\"\n- \"Should I use Redis or in-memory HashMap for caching?\"\n- \"Is this service ready for production?\"\n- \"Convene the full guild on this proposal\"\n\n## The 13 Agents\n\nAgents are named after thought leaders whose work defines their domain (Lamport for distributed systems, Dijkstra for correctness, Taleb for resilience). See `docs/explanation/bibliography.md` for the full lineage.\n\n### 7 Masters (Always Active)\n\nThese agents review every architectural decision.\n\n| Agent | Domain | Core Question |\n|-------|--------|---------------|\n| **K** | Strategic | What forces are at play? What move creates options? |\n| **Karman** | Ontological/Naming | Does code model match business reality? |\n| **Burner** | Structural/Boundaries | Are dependencies clean? Do they point inward? |\n| **Lamport** | Temporal/Distributed | What happens with latency, partitions, eventual consistency? |\n| **Erlang** | Hydraulic/Capacity | If inflow exceeds outflow, where is the valve? |\n| **Vector** | Adversarial/Security | If I control the input, how do I break this? |\n| **Ace** | Psychocentric/DX | Can the next developer figure this out in 15 minutes? |\n\n### 6 Specialists (Context-Triggered)\n\nThese agents activate when specific conditions appear.\n\n| Agent | Domain | Trigger |\n|-------|--------|---------|\n| **Ixian** | Empirical/Validation | Always — mandatory post-consensus |\n| **Dijkstra** | Deductive/Correctness | Critical paths: auth, payments, state machines |\n| **Knuth** | Complexity/Performance | Loops, aggregations, high-cardinality data |\n| **Lotfi** | Fuzzy/Tradeoffs | Agent deadlocks (K says yes, Dijkstra says no) |\n| **Taleb** | Antifragile/Resilience | Production readiness, failure modes |\n| **Chesterton** | Diachronic/Legacy | Removing old code, refactoring legacy systems |\n\n## Guild Modes\n\n| Mode | Agents | Use When |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| **Methodology** | Relevant subset | Default — let context determine |\n| **Quick** | 7 Masters | Fast review, broad coverage |\n| **Focus** | 3-4 targeted | Specific concern (security, performance) |\n| **Full** | All 13 | Major decisions, comprehensive review |\n\n## Verdicts\n\n| Verdict | Meaning | Action |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n| **APPROVE** | No concerns from this perspective | Proceed |\n| **CONCERN** | Minor issues, acceptable short-term | Proceed with awareness |\n| **OBJECTION** | Significant issues | Address before proceeding |\n| **BLOCK** | Fundamental problem | Cannot proceed |\n\n## The Ratchet\n\nThe Guild learns across sessions.
