Not tutorials — standards, decision frameworks, and the reasoning behind them.\n\n## When It Activates\n\n- Writing code or making technical decisions\n- Refactoring and code reviews\n- Debugging (especially when stuck)\n- Implementation work requiring quality standards\n\n## What You Get\n\n### The Skill (build-core)\n\nEngineering methodology grounded in:\n- Software Craftsmanship Manifesto principles\n- Evidence-based decision making\n- First principles reasoning\n- Scientific method for verification\n\n### The Agent (Mr. Wolf)\n\n**Structured problem solver.** Gets called when you're stuck, going in circles, or debugging isn't converging.\n\nMr. Wolf:\n1. Stops what isn't working\n2. Clarifies what's actually happening\n3. Identifies the type of problem\n4. Breaks it down systematically\n5. Verifies before declaring solved\n\n### The Hooks (Automatic Assistance)\n\nTwo hooks detect patterns that need intervention:\n\n| Hook | Detects | Response |\n|------|---------|----------|\n| `detect-debugging-loop` | 3+ consecutive failures | Spawns Mr. Wolf |\n| `detect-frustration` | User frustration signals | Spawns Mr. Wolf |\n\n**To disable hooks:** Set environment variable `SKIP_MRWOLF_HOOKS=1`\n\n```bash\nSKIP_MRWOLF_HOOKS=1 claude\n```\n\n## Structure\n\n```\ncore-1337/\n├── skills/build-core/\n│   ├── SKILL.md              # Engineering methodology\n│   └── references/           # Deep dives (verification, reasoning, etc.)\n├── agents/\n│   └── mrwolf.md             # Structured problem solver\n├── hooks/\n│   ├── hooks.json            # Hook configuration\n│   ├── detect-debugging-loop.sh\n│   ├── detect-frustration.sh\n│   └── session-start.sh      # Session transparency\n└── scripts/                  # Installation helpers\n```\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**You're not done when it works. You're done when it's right.**\n\nEverything you create becomes part of a system others depend on. Your work is inherited. Your standards are inherited. Do the right thing because it's right.\n",{"agents":13,"skills":13,"hooks":14,"commands":15},1,3,0,"constraint",[]],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
