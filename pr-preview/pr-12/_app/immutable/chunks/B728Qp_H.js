They also score 17% worse on unassisted assessments (Bastani, n=1,000) and lose 20% of skill proficiency after three months of AI use (Budzyń).</p> <p>The perception gap compounds the problem. Experienced developers predicted AI would make them 24% faster; measurements showed they were 19% slower — a 43-point gap between perception and reality (METR). Trust in AI coding accuracy dropped from 43% to 33% in one year, yet adoption rose from 76% to 84% (Stack Overflow). People use tools they don’t trust, perceive benefits they don’t get.</p> <p>Confidence in AI negatively correlates with critical thinking (β = -0.69, Lee). The more you rely on AI, the less you verify it. The less you verify, the more errors propagate.</p> <hr/> <h2>Explanation</h2> <p><strong>The paradox is structural, not incidental.</strong></p> <p>AI shifts cognitive work from generation to verification. Writing from scratch disappears. Reviewing mostly-correct output appears. This feels easier because the hard part (creation) is gone. But catching subtle errors in plausible-looking code demands sustained attention — a different kind of hard.</p> <p>Seniors edit AI output enough to offset time savings (30% vs 17% for juniors). They ship 2.5x more AI code to production despite lower trust. They have the judgment to verify; juniors don’t.</p> <p>The productivity illusion persists because generation was visible effort. Verification is invisible effort. The work feels lighter even when it isn’t. And the perception gap prevents correction — you can’t fix what you don’t notice.</p> <p><strong>Three mechanisms drive hollowing:</strong></p> <p><em>Cognitive offloading.</em> When AI handles thinking, humans stop doing it. Kosmyna’s MIT study showed this neurologically — 83% couldn’t recall content from their own AI-assisted writing. They didn’t forget. They never encoded it.</p> <p><em>Trust without calibration.</em> Explanations increase acceptance regardless of correctness (Bansal, CHI 2021). When AI is right, explanations help slightly. When AI is wrong, performance degrades. Trust rises; verification falls.</p> <p><em>Skill atrophy.</em> Skills require practice. Remove the practice, lose the skill. The Lancet study is cleanest: 20% detection rate decline in 12 weeks after AI removal. No equivalent study exists for developers — the technology is too new. But the cognitive mechanisms are identical.</p> <p><strong>The perception gap prevents correction.</strong></p> <p>People don’t notice degradation. They feel more productive while being less capable. This isn’t ignorance — it’s how expertise works. You can’t assess competence in a domain where you lack competence. AI accelerates this by providing confident answers to questions you don’t fully understand.</p> <p>The same studies that show productivity gains show the perception gap. Both effects are real. Productivity now, atrophy later. The question is which dominates over time — and whether design can change the trajectory.</p>',1);function p(e){var t=n();r(44),o(e,t)}export{p as default};
