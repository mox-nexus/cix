Every extension in this ecosystem is designed to make you more capable, not dependent.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nuv tool install cix\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Add a source (marketplace of extensions)\ncix source add https://github.com/mox-nexus/cix-extensions\n\n# List available extensions\ncix list -a\n\n# Install an extension\ncix add reasoning-frameworks\n\n# See what's installed\ncix list\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n### Sources (Extension Marketplaces)\n\n```bash\ncix source add \u003Curl>        # Register a source\ncix source list             # Show registered sources\ncix source rm \u003Cname>        # Remove a source\ncix source refresh [name]   # Fetch latest from source(s)\n```\n\n### Extensions\n\n```bash\ncix list [-a] [-v]          # List installed (or -a available) extensions\ncix add \u003Cextension>         # Install an extension\ncix rm \u003Cextension>          # Remove an extension\ncix update [extension]      # Update extension(s)\ncix show \u003Cextension>        # Show extension details\n```\n\n### System\n\n```bash\ncix info                    # Show cix configuration and status\n```\n\n## Extension Types\n\n| Type | Purpose | Example |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| **Skill** | Decision frameworks and methodology | reasoning-patterns |\n| **Agent** | Specialized subagents for delegation | structured-problem-solver |\n| **Hook** | Event-triggered behaviors | metacognitive-check |\n| **MCP** | External service integrations | knowledge-base-connector |\n\n## Design Principles\n\n1. **Complementary, not Substitutive** - Extensions enhance your capability, they don't replace it\n2. **Transparent Reasoning** - See why, not just what\n3. **Human-Initiated** - You control when and how extensions engage\n4. **Evidence-Based** - Claims are grounded in research and experience\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",{"agents":13,"skills":13,"hooks":13,"commands":13},0,"spark",[4,16],"cli",{"slug":18,"kind":4,"manifest":19,"tagline":23,"readme":24,"components":25,"variant":26,"tags":27},"memex",{"name":18,"version":20,"description":21,"author":22},"0.2.0","Extended memory for you and your agents.
